     *
     * TWO requirements, and the second is easy to lose sight of:
     *
     * 1. FAITHFUL. Each rendered number must not misstate its own value. Rounding to
     *    whole GB reported a 1 MB overshoot as "11 GB vs 10 GB" — a 1000x
     *    exaggeration that tells the user to free a gigabyte they don't need to, and
     *    contradicts the slider label right above it (sliders print `mb/1000 + ' GB'`,
     *    so 10500 reads "10.5 GB" there and must not read "11 GB" here).
     * 2. DISTINGUISHABLE. The warning fires on a strict `>` by as little as 1 MB and
     *    the sliders step by 100, so the two numbers are often close. Independent
     *    rounding printed "add up to 45 GB … only holds 45 GB" — self-refuting.
     *
     * Both are satisfied by picking, for THIS value, the fewest decimals (0..2) that
     * render it exactly AND separate it from the counterpart at the same precision.
     *
     * The two sides may therefore end up with different decimal counts ("12 GB … 9.6 GB",
     * "5 GB … ~4.4 GB") — fidelity is worth more than a matched pair, and the `~` marker
     * explains any asymmetry. An earlier version required exactness of BOTH values to
     * force a shared precision; because ceilings are derived and essentially never round,
     * that pushed ~90% of realistic pairs into the raw MB fallback ("58300 MB" beside a
     * slider reading "58.3 GB") — the very thing this function exists to prevent.
     *
     * Exactness is therefore required only of the value being RENDERED, never of the
     * counterpart. A value that isn't exactly representable at <=2 decimals is rendered
     * approximately by its own call (`~42.3 GB`, see {@link _gbApprox}), so no number
     * ever reads as exact when it isn't. Bare MB is the last resort, reached only when
     * the pair is close enough that no GB precision separates them.

     * Render (or hide) the advisory banner for `category` into `elementId`.
     *
     * Renders only when the volume is measurable AND overcommitted. An unmounted
     * or unreadable volume yields measurable=false server-side and is skipped —
     * warning off a StatFs that momentarily read 0 would make the banner flap
     * with every FUSE hiccup, and the existing fallback banner already covers
     * "your card isn't there".
     *
     * Two severities, because they are different problems:
     *   overCapacity  — Σ limits exceed the card's total size. Impossible even on
     *                   an empty card; the user must lower a limit.
     *   overReachable — Σ limits fit the card in principle but not alongside what
     *                   is already on it (BYD's own CDR dashcam files, other apps).
     *                   Freeing foreign data is also a valid fix, so the copy says so.
     *
     * @param elementId Container element id; absent element = no-op (pages opt in).
     * @param budget    The `storageBudget` array from the settings response.
     * @param category  The calling page's own category key.
     * @param pendingMb Optional unsaved slider value for `category`; when given the
     *                  sum is recomputed with it in place of the stored limit.
     * @param pendingType Optional unsaved storage-type pick. When it differs from the
     *                  volume the server has this category on, the advisory retargets
     *                  to the destination volume and adds the pending limit to ITS sum
     *                  (the category isn't in that volume's list yet).
     * @returns true when a warning is showing.
