/**
 * Resolves the instantaneous charge rate in kW from sources whose UNIT is decided at runtime.
 *
 * <p>Since the collector now stores every charging accessor RAW, a stored value is only a kW rate
 * if that source has been classified {@code RATE}. A source classified {@code COUNTER} holds
 * cumulative kWh, so its rate is the slope of successive readings, not the reading itself.
 * Publishing a counter's value as kW is a 10-100x error, which is exactly the defect this
 * subsystem exists to remove.
 *
 * <p>Rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code RATE} → the value IS the kW, published as measured.</li>
 *   <li>{@code COUNTER} → differentiate. Measured (it comes from a metered quantity), but it needs
 *       two readings, so it is unavailable on the first observation of a charge.</li>
 *   <li>{@code UNKNOWN} → refuse, except for an out-of-physical-range raw value whose exact known
 *       100x unit is proven by a fresh independent same-session pack-flow observation. This narrow
 *       exception handles raw 650/700 without making ordinary ambiguous values publishable.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Drivetrain-independent by construction: the decision is a property of the firmware's
 * behaviour, not of PHEV vs BEV, so the same code serves both. The previous design had to gate the
 * cluster source to one drivetrain precisely because its unit was a guess.
