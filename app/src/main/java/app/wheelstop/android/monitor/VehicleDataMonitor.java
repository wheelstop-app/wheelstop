     * Charging state derivation — fused detector.
     *
     * The "is charging?" decision is owned by {@link ChargingDetector},
     * which fuses three independent signals and two edge inputs:
     *
     *   L1. BMS state edge (chargingState == 1) via the typed
     *       AbsBYDAutoChargingListener registered in BydDataCollector.
     *   L2. BYDAutoPowerDevice.isCharging() polled once per cycle as a
     *       cross-check that catches the PHEV "BMS stuck at 15 IDLE while
     *       charging" firmware bug.
     *   L3. Power-flow inference with hysteresis and a positive AC/DC gun
     *       assertion (gun==2/3/4/5; UNAVAILABLE no longer slips through
     *       like the old "!= 1 disconnected" guard).
     *   E1. ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED — biases fusion toward charging during
     *       the ramp-up window before BMS reports.
     *   E2. ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED — overrides the fused state to
     *       NOT_CHARGING for {@code UNPLUG_OVERRIDE_MS} so a stale BMS
     *       value can't keep us in "charging" after the cable comes out.
     *
     * This method is now a thin presentation wrapper: ask the detector
     * for the verdict, choose an effective state code (CHARGING when the
     * detector says yes, else the BMS state if known, else null), and
     * resolve power magnitude.
     *
     * Power magnitude resolution (when fused says CHARGING) SPLITS BY DRIVETRAIN,
     * because the hardware getters that are authoritative on BEV are actively
     * wrong on PHEV — getExternalChargingPower() reports the EVSE's RATED
     * capacity there (a flat 7.13 kW on a real ~1.7 kW charge) and
     * getChargePower() has been seen returning the AC-side figure:
     *
     *   PHEV:
     *     1. clusterChargePowerKw — the cluster's own dash readout (feature id
     *        0x32300018). Measured, available on the first poll, and PHEV-only
     *        because its raw scale is inferred (see the branch comment below).
     *     2. ring-buffer estimator — SOC-derived, needs ≥2 SOC ticks to warm up.
     *     3. abs(engine power) when current is flowing into the pack.
     *     4. nominal-capacity hint (3.3/7 kW, marked estimated).
     *   PHEV deliberately NEVER falls through to externalChargingPower /
     *   chargingDevice.chargingPower — a confidently-wrong measured-looking
     *   value is worse than an honest estimate.
     *
     *   BEV:
     *     1. chargePower (InstrumentDevice.getChargePower — real DC rate INTO the
     *        pack; matches the BYD app/cloud). Preferred over externalChargingPower
     *        because that one is the AC wall-side input (higher: includes
     *        onboard-charger conversion loss) or a 104857.5 sentinel.
     *     2. external charging power (InstrumentDevice — charger-reported, AC-side)
     *     3. chargingDevice.chargingPower
     *     4. abs(engine power) — only when ACC is on (NaN-guarded after
     *        ACC OFF invalidation in BydDataCollector.setAccState)
     *     5. ring-buffer counter-derivative estimator (measured, not nominal)
     *     6. nominal-capacity hint (7 kW, marked estimated)
     *
     * @return ChargingStateData populated from the fused detector, or
     *         null when no state signal is available at all.
