/**
 * Ring-buffer charging-power estimator — a FALLBACK power source for BYD models
 * that report no direct/external charging power (the charger-reported getters
 * read 0/UNAVAILABLE and the {@code onExternalChargingPowerChanged} callback is
 * silent under uid-2000, so {@link VehicleDataMonitor#getChargingState()} would
 * otherwise fall through to a nominal placeholder and the UI shows "--").
 *
 * <p>Mechanism: differentiate a monotonic charge-energy counter over a sliding
 * window — {@code ΔkWh × 3_600_000 / Δms = kW}. We feed it two counters: remaining
 * pack energy ({@code remainKwh}, PREFERRED) and the cumulative session
 * charge-energy counter ({@code chargingCapacityKwh}, fallback only); both rise
 * only while charging, so their positive time-derivative is charging power.
 * {@code remainKwh} is preferred because it is verified full-scale and SOC-tracking
 * on real hardware, whereas {@code getChargingCapacity()} is an unvalidated HAL
 * counter that on at least the Seal trim rises at ~half the true energy rate
 * (the BYD half-scale getter pattern) — differentiating it produced the
 * "charging power stuck at ~half" bug, so it is now used only when remain yields
 * no delta. Power is the slope across the WHOLE window (total ΔkWh / total Δt),
 * NOT a per-interval derivative: at the ~90 s parked cadence a single interval's
 * rise is only 1-2 counter quanta, so per-interval division amplified the ±½-quantum
 * error to ±50% and beat against the poll cadence — the periodic "8 → 3.3 → 8"
 * oscillation. Spanning the window averages that quantisation error down to ≈ q/WINDOW.
 * The slope is then EMA-smoothed across cycles.
 *
 * <p><b>Regen / V2L safety:</b> {@link #sample} only accumulates while the fused
 * {@link ChargingDetector} verdict is CHARGING <i>and</i> the car is in Park, and
 * only counts strictly-increasing counter values. Driving regen (gear D/R) and
 * V2L discharge (counter falling) are therefore structurally excluded — the
 * estimator clears its buffers the moment either gate opens, so a stale value can
 * never latch a phantom reading.
 *
 * <p><b>Accuracy caveat:</b> the daemon polls every ~5 s (ACC on) but ~90 s while
 * parked, and the counter resolution can be coarse (≈0.1 kWh), so the parked-AC
 * estimate is approximate. It is intentionally a last-resort source ordered
 * AFTER every real power getter and is only as alive as the counter feeding it —
 * if the model reports no capacity/remaining-energy movement either, this yields
 * nothing and the nominal placeholder still applies.
 *
 * <p>Threading: all access via {@code synchronized(lock)} — {@link #sample} runs
 * on the collector thread, {@link #estimatePowerKw} from HTTP/daemon threads.
