/**
 * Daemon-side [WarningCoordinator.VisualSink] (D-024): turns the coordinator's
 * "show this approach / clear it" calls into an [OverlayState] written to UCM
 * `roadSense.overlayState`. The app-side `RoadSenseOverlayService` polls that and
 * renders — this class writes no UI, just state.
 *
 * Calibration level (the green/orange/red dot, R-OVL-1) isn't known to the
 * WarningCoordinator, so the controller supplies it via [calibrationLevelSupplier]
 * (typically `VehicleCalibrator.maturity`, optionally blended with confirmed-hazard
 * density later). A pending Calibration-Mode confirm is injected separately by the
 * controller via [setPendingConfirm] and rides along on the next write.
 *
 * Threading: written only on the daemon warn-tick thread (NOT a UI thread —
 * feedback_no_unified_writes_on_ui_thread). `updateSection` is a full-JSON rewrite,
 * so we COALESCE: only write when the rendered state actually changes (distance is
 * bucketed to whole metres + a min-interval), so we don't rewrite the config file
 * dozens of times a second. `clock` injected for testability.
