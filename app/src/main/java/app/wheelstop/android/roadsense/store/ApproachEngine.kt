/**
 * Given the live vehicle [Pose] and the hazards in nearby tiles, answer the
 * question the overlay + warning layer keep asking: **"what's the next hazard
 * ahead, how far, and in which direction?"** (R-OVL-2, R-EXT-4).
 *
 * Pure ranking/geometry — no DB, no Android, no clock. The caller fetches
 * candidate rows from [RoadSenseStore.queryAhead] (tile-scoped, cheap) and hands
 * them here; this stage does the precise metric + bearing-cone filtering that is
 * wasteful to express in SQL. Keeping it pure makes the "is it ahead / how far"
 * logic unit-testable, which is where direction-aware warnings live or die.
 *
 * ## What "ahead" means + "our road"
 * A hazard is *ahead* if the bearing FROM the car TO the hazard is within
 * [forwardConeDeg] of the car's travel bearing. This is the R-EXT-4 direction
 * filter: a pothole 8 m away in the opposite carriageway is behind the cone and
 * must NOT warn. We also drop anything farther than [maxRangeM] (out of interest)
 * and — by default — anything already essentially under the car (< [minRangeM],
 * too late to warn, avoids a "0 m" flicker).
 *
 * The forward cone keeps things geometrically ahead, but that alone can still leak
 * a hazard on a PARALLEL/opposite/crossing road that happens to fall in the cone at
 * a bend or junction. So we ALSO require a ROAD MATCH: the hazard's stored detection
 * heading must align with our travel heading in the SAME direction within
 * [headingMatchDeg] (the opposite carriageway is NOT accepted — R-EXT-4). And when
 * the heading is unreliable (crawl / no GPS bearing) we suppress entirely rather than
 * warn omnidirectionally. This guarantees "warn only for the road we're driving, in
 * our direction," not the next street over or the oncoming lane.
 *
 * Heading sanity: at very low speed GPS bearing is noisy/garbage, so the caller
 * passes whether the heading is trustworthy; when it isn't we SUPPRESS entirely
 * (rank returns empty) rather than warn omnidirectionally — without a reliable
 * heading we can't tell our road/direction from the opposite carriageway or a
 * cross street, and at crawl speed the driver can already see the bump (R-EXT-4).
