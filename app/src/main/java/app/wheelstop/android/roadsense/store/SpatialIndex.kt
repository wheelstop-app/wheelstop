/**
 * Spatial bucketing for RoadSense's "ahead of me" hazard lookups [D-006].
 *
 * Instead of an R-tree (extension dependency, not available in H2 by default
 * and overkill for a few-thousand-row local store), we quantize lat/lng to a
 * fixed grid of ~50 m cells and pack the (latCell, lngCell) pair into a single
 * `Long`. That gives an O(1) bucket key we can index in H2 and use verbatim in
 * `WHERE tile IN (...)` for both the local approach query and the delta-sync
 * tile cursor (R-CRD-5) — same key on both sides of the wire.
 *
 * Pure object: no Android imports, fully unit-testable. The [GeoMath] helpers
 * (Haversine distance + bearing) live alongside it because the ApproachEngine,
 * the store's merge-radius check, and the consensus model all need them.
 *
 * ── Cell-size math ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One degree of latitude is ~111_320 m everywhere on Earth, so:
 *
 *     50 m / 111_320 m·deg⁻¹ ≈ 0.000449 deg of latitude per 50 m cell.
 *
 * We round to [CELL_DEG] = 0.00045 (a hair over 50 m, ~50.1 m — close enough
 * that a hazard never straddles more than the current + neighbour cells we
 * already query).
 *
 * Longitude is the awkward axis: a degree of longitude shrinks with latitude
 * (× cos(lat)), so a fixed 0.00045-deg lng cell is ~50 m at the equator but
 * only ~35 m at 45° and ~25 m at 60°. We DELIBERATELY DO NOT correct for that
 * here, and the simplification is safe for two reasons:
 *   1. Cells getting *smaller* toward the poles only makes the grid finer than
 *      50 m — it never makes a cell larger than ~50 m, so a hazard still falls
 *      inside the current-or-neighbour 3×3 block that [neighborTiles] returns.
 *   2. The actual "is this the same hazard / is it within warn range" decisions
 *      are made with true-metric [GeoMath.haversineMeters], never with the cell
 *      grid. The grid is only a coarse pre-filter to keep SQL off a full scan.
 * A cos(lat)-corrected lng cell would buy nothing but a latitude-dependent key
 * that no longer round-trips cleanly to the cloud tile space, so we keep it
 * simple and uniform-in-degrees. Revisit only if hazard density ever demands a
 * tighter pre-filter (D-006: "revisit only if density demands it").
