/**
 * The primary process-boundary seam for RoadSense (D-023).
 *
 * RoadSense's detection pipeline (GravityFrame → EventDetector → …) consumes IMU
 * samples without caring where they came from. There are three implementations:
 *
 *   - **app side:** `RoadSenseImuSidecarService` reads the real `-iner` sensors
 *     (via [ImuSource]) and pushes batched samples to the daemon over IPC.
 *   - **daemon side:** an IPC receiver decodes those batches and replays them
 *     into the pipeline. (The daemon is where ALL logic runs, D-023.)
 *   - **test/replay:** a fake that feeds recorded CSV/synthetic samples, so the
 *     whole engine is unit/replay-testable with zero hardware.
 *
 * Keeping the pipeline behind this interface is what let us move IMU acquisition
 * to the app process (where 100 Hz is proven, F-005) while running detection in
 * the daemon (where GPS + vehicle singletons already live, D-020) — the two
 * sides only ever exchange [ImuAccelSample] / [ImuGyroSample] (the shared types).
 *
 * Callbacks are invoked on the producer's thread (sensor thread app-side, IPC
 * reader thread daemon-side). Implementations document their threading; the
 * consumer (the pipeline) is single-threaded and must not block these callbacks.
