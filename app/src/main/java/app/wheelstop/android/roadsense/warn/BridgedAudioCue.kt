/**
 * [WarningCoordinator.AudioCue] that plays the approach chime through the APP-PROCESS
 * media player, so it can ride a chosen audio channel — in particular the OEM-extended
 * navigation stream (`STREAM_NAVI`, 14), where the head unit's own guidance prompts play.
 *
 * ## Why not SoundPool / ToneGenerator (the two cues this replaces)
 * Both ran in the daemon and could only reach usage-routed or public streams:
 * [SoundPoolAudioCue] sets `USAGE_ASSISTANCE_SONIFICATION` with no legacy stream type,
 * and [ToneAudioCue] is hardwired to `STREAM_MUSIC`. Neither can address stream 14 —
 * `AudioAttributes.setLegacyStreamType` alone doesn't reach the OEM-extended streams;
 * only `MediaPlayer.setAudioStreamType` does, and that needs a MediaPlayer that can
 * actually prepare, which the daemon has none of (prepare fails `0x80000000`).
 *
 * So the chime goes through the same proven app-process bridge and channel-routing recipe
 * as "Play Audio", but in `RoadSenseChimePlaybackService`. The separate player prevents
 * a warning from replacing looping Automation Audio, or an automation from cancelling a
 * chime while it prepares. See [AudioPlaybackController.playRawResource].
 *
 * ## Cost
 * One `am` exec per chime, on the daemon warn-tick thread, fire-and-forget. Chimes are
 * globally rate-limited by `WarningCoordinator.AUDIO_COOLOFF_MS` (12 s) and fire on a
 * ~4 s approach lead, so neither the latency nor the service churn matters.
 *
 * [channelSupplier] and [volumeSupplier] are read per chime so settings changes take
 * effect without a restart.
