/**
 * Decides RoadSense's operating regime from vehicle state (D-021).
 *
 * RoadSense only has value while the car is actually being driven, so it scales
 * its own resource use by gear + ACC into three regimes:
 *
 *   DRIVING  (gear D/M/S, ACC on) — full rate: IMU @ ~100 Hz, full pipeline.
 *   RELAXED  (gear P/N/R, ACC on) — you cannot hit a pothole while stopped/parked;
 *            drop IMU to a slow rate (or unregister), pause event detection, keep
 *            light state resident for instant resume when D returns.
 *   OFF      (ACC off)            — completely silent: unregister IMU, stop the
 *            detector, release buffers/threads, persist pending state. ~zero cost.
 *
 * This is PURE policy — no Android, no sensors, no side effects. The owning
 * controller calls [evaluate] whenever gear/ACC change and acts on the returned
 * [Regime] (and on [transition] to know what to actually start/stop). Keeping it
 * pure means the regime logic is unit-testable in isolation, which matters
 * because mis-gating either wastes battery (too hot) or misses hazards (too cold).
 *
 * ACC takes priority over gear: ACC off ⇒ OFF regardless of last-known gear
 * (the bus may report a stale gear after shutdown; ACC is the authoritative
 * "is the car alive" signal — AccMonitor, see D-020).
