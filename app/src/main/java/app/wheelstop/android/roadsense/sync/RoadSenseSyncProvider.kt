/**
 * The crowdsource transport seam (D-002). All cloud I/O goes through this so the
 * concrete backend (Cloudflare Workers + D1, D-009) can change without touching
 * detection/store/controller. There's exactly one impl today
 * ([CloudflareEdgeSyncProvider]); a no-op/replay impl is trivial for tests.
 *
 * Two independent directions, mirroring the two independent user toggles (R-SET-2,
 * R-CRD-6): [download] (pull confirmed hazards near a route) and [upload] (push
 * this device's high-confidence local hazards). Both are opt-in, default OFF —
 * the controller only calls these when the respective config flag is on.
 *
 * All methods are blocking network calls — the caller (a daemon sync tick) runs
 * them off the detection/IMU path. Implementations must never throw to the caller;
 * they return a result object so a dead network / bad URL degrades gracefully
 * (offline-first, R-EXT-7) rather than crashing the daemon.
