/**
 * Adapts the daemon's already-running [BydDataCollector] singleton into the
 * RoadSense [VehicleDynamics] contract (D-020).
 *
 * RoadSense does NOT start its own BYD polling — that would double the SDK load
 * and split-brain the telemetry (user mandate: reuse existing instances). The
 * collector lives in the CameraDaemon process and is started/owned by it, so
 * RoadSense (also daemon-side, D-023) just reads the latest immutable snapshot
 * via `getData()` on each detector tick. `getData()` returns an `AtomicReference`
 * snapshot — lock-free, safe from any thread.
 *
 * ## Staleness note (carried into VehicleDynamics.brakeAgeMs)
 * The collector polls vehicle data on a fixed cadence (~5 s ACC-on, ~90 s parked
 * per F-011 / the collector's constants). Speed + steering are relatively fresh;
 * brake/accel/gear can be up to a poll-interval old. We surface that age in
 * `brakeAgeMs` (now − snapshot.timestamp) so `RejectionFilter` can DISCOUNT stale
 * pedal/gear readings near a fast ~200 ms event rather than trusting a 4 s-old
 * "brake 90%". This is exactly why the contract carries the age.
 *
 * FAST DYNAMICS (R-PERF-4, implemented): the collector now exposes an opt-in,
 * narrowly-scoped fast poll of ONLY brake/accel/gear/speed (BydDataCollector
 * .getFastDynamics(), ~250 ms), which RoadSenseController starts while the feature
 * is enabled + DRIVING. When that tuple is present AND fresher than the main
 * snapshot, we use it — so pedal/gear are event-aligned to ~200 ms jolts instead of
 * up to ~5 s stale. When it's absent (RoadSense off / not driving / unsupported
 * trim) we transparently fall back to the 5 s `getData()` snapshot, and `brakeAgeMs`
 * still reports the true age so RejectionFilter discounts stale pedal/gear exactly
 * as before. This is the "faster cadence using the daemon's own device handles, not
 * a competing poller" path the original note prescribed.
 *
 * Pure read-through; no state, thread-safe. `nowMs` is injected so this stays
 * unit-testable (no System.currentTimeMillis baked in).
