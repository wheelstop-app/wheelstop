/**
 * Streaming, sliding-window biphasic-pulse detector — the stage that turns the
 * `a_vert` residual stream from [GravityFrame] into raw [DetectionCandidate]s.
 *
 * ## What it keys on (the hardware truth — see dev/roadsense/05-FINDINGS.md)
 *
 * A real road feature at speed shows up on the vertical channel as a **biphasic
 * pulse**: the suspension loads one way then rebounds the other. F-007 measured a
 * textbook speed bump at ~30 km/h as `−2.0 m/s² (load) → +3.5 m/s² (crest) →
 * rebound`, total ≈ 180 ms, ≈ 18 samples at 100 Hz, peak 3.5 vs a driving noise
 * floor of ±0.18 m/s² stdev (F-005) ⇒ ~19× SNR. So the signal is clean and the
 * morphology is what we extract:
 *
 *   - **peakUp / peakDown** — the two excursions of the biphasic pulse.
 *   - **dipLeading** — down-first (pothole-ish) vs up-first/crest-first
 *     (breaker-ish). F-007 + 03-ARCHITECTURE §Severity: potholes are dip-leading
 *     with a sharper rise (<40 ms); breakers are crest-leading / symmetric.
 *   - **riseTimeMs** — zero-cross → first peak. Pothole ≪ breaker (the sharp-edge
 *     vs ramped-profile distinction the classifier downstream reasons on).
 *   - **durationMs** — total span; a real event is ~150–200 ms (~15–20 samples).
 *   - **axlePairGapMs** — if a second same-shape pulse arrives one wheelbase-time
 *     later (`Δt = wheelbase / v`), it's almost certainly a real transverse road
 *     feature (front axle then rear axle hit the same bump). High-confidence cue.
 *
 * ## Why streaming, not batch
 *
 * This runs inside the app-process foreground service at the sensor rate
 * (99.9 Hz, F-005). R-PERF-1/3: compute and memory are constrained. So:
 *   - one sample in via [onSample], at most one candidate out;
 *   - a **fixed-size primitive ring buffer** (FloatArray + parallel LongArray for
 *     timestamps), NOT a growing collection — no per-sample allocation, no boxing;
 *   - the ONLY allocation on the hot path is the returned [DetectionCandidate]
 *     when an event actually completes (rare — a handful per drive).
 *
 * ## Threading
 *
 * NOT thread-safe — by design. The owning [RoadSenseService] feeds it from a
 * single sensor-callback thread (same contract as [GravityFrame]). Do not call
 * [onSample] concurrently.
 *
 * ## What this stage does NOT do
 *
 * It does not reject (turns/braking/washboard — that's [RejectionFilter]), does
 * not classify severity/type, and does not localize. It is the dumb morphology
 * extractor. It DOES derive [DetectionCandidate.lateralAsymmetry] from the
 * gravity-free horizontal residual ([VerticalSample.aHoriz], supplied by
 * [GravityFrame.horizontalResidual]) paired with the vertical peak — a one-wheel
 * pothole rolls the body (horizontal-dominant) where a full-width breaker stays
 * vertical (R-DET-3). When the vertical peak is too weak to trust the ratio,
 * `asymmetryValid` is left false so downstream gates ignore it.
