/**
 * Per-tile "last synced" timestamps for delta downloads (R-CRD-5).
 *
 * The free-of-cost guarantee (G-6) hinges on never re-downloading data we already
 * have. For each map tile we remember the newest `updated_ms` we've pulled; the
 * next download asks the server only for rows newer than that. A device driving
 * its usual commute therefore pulls almost nothing after the first sync of each
 * tile — exactly the property that keeps us inside Cloudflare's free tier.
 *
 * Persisted in the `roadSense` UCM section under `tileCursors` (a tile→ms map) so
 * cursors survive daemon restarts. Kept small: we prune tiles not touched in a
 * long time (a cursor for a tile you'll never revisit is dead weight).
 *
 * Thread-safety: although the sync tick is the primary caller, [clear] is invoked
 * from the daemon HTTP handler thread (RoadSenseController.deleteCloudUploads via
 * RoadSenseApiHandler.handleDeleteCloud) — a DIFFERENT thread from the tick that
 * runs [sinceMap]/[advance] (audit concurrency). Concurrent structural mutation of
 * a plain HashMap can throw or corrupt its table, so every public method guards the
 * map with [lock]. The mutations are tiny; this never touches the 100 Hz hot path.

     *    its OWN query floor only (not to any other tile's data), so we advance it
     *    there. This still kills the re-pull-forever cost (G-6) because each tile's
     *    floor is its own last cursor, not a global minimum.
     *  - [tileHighWater]: tiles that DID return rows advance to the newest row
     *    actually seen FOR THAT TILE.
