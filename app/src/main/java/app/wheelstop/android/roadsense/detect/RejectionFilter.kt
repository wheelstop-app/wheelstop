/**
 * Rolling gyro statistics over the event window, pre-summarized.
 *
 * WHY a pre-summarized struct instead of `List<ImuGyroSample>`:
 * the detection hot path runs per-event at ~200 ms resolution and the gyro
 * arrives at 99.9 Hz (F-006) — handing a fresh sublist to [RejectionFilter] on
 * every candidate means an allocation + a min/max scan inside the rejection
 * path. The owning [RoadSenseService] already keeps a streaming sliding window
 * over the IMU ring buffer (R-PERF-3); it can maintain these two peaks for free
 * as samples arrive and snapshot them at event time. So we keep [evaluate]
 * allocation-free and O(1), and push the cheap rolling work to where the samples
 * already flow.
 *
 * Both values are PEAK ABSOLUTE rates over the window (sign discarded — we only
 * care "how hard is the body rotating", not which way).
 *
 *  - [peakYawRateRps]  : peak |yaw rate| (rad/s). Yaw = cornering. This is the
 *                        gyro corroboration for the steering-angle reject (F-006:
 *                        gyro saw 0.088→0.347 rad/s on a hard turn). The device
 *                        frame is tilted ~9.2° (F-005) so a "yaw" axis isn't
 *                        perfectly isolated; the service should feed the largest
 *                        horizontal-plane rotation rate here. For rejection
 *                        purposes the exact axis split doesn't matter — any large
 *                        sustained rotation during a vertical jolt means the body
 *                        is turning, not hitting a transverse road feature.

/**
 * Decides whether a [DetectionCandidate] is a real road hazard or a driver-/
 * vehicle-caused artefact that must NOT be mapped or warned on.
 *
 * This is THE component that has to pass gate **G-4** (zero false warnings from
 * braking/cornering on the adversarial drive — hard-brake ×10, sharp-turn ×10).
 * It implements R-DET-5 (reject braking, cornering, expansion joints,
 * cobblestone/washboard, curb strikes, door slams), R-DET-8 / D-018
 * (vehicle-dynamics fusion), using the BYD bus snapshot ([VehicleDynamics],
 * F-011) plus pre-summarized gyro ([GyroStats], F-006).
 *
 * ## Precision vs recall stance
 * G-4 makes false positives from brake/turn the cardinal sin, so when the
 * vehicle bus *clearly* says "the driver did this" (brake mashed, big steering,
 * launch) we lean toward rejecting even at some recall cost — those signals are
 * direct measurements of driver input, not inference. BUT the per-phase recall
 * gates (G-1: ≥90% breaker / ≥75% pothole recall) still matter, so the rules are
 * structured so each individual reject needs a *strong, specific* trigger; we do
 * NOT reject on weak or stale evidence. Where a threshold trades precision for
 * recall is called out at each const.
 *
 * ## Staleness (the central nuance, F-011 / D-018 caveat)
 * brake% / accel% / gear are ~5 s polls in the current collector; speed +
 * steering are low-latency push listeners. [VehicleDynamics.brakeAgeMs] is the
 * age of the brake/accel/gear poll. A 4-second-old "brake 90%" tells us nothing
 * about *this* 180 ms jolt, so we only act on pedal/gear evidence when it is
 * fresh ([STALE_PEDAL_MS]). For cornering, steering is push (fresh) AND gyro
 * corroborates, so cornering rejection survives even when the pedal poll is
 * stale — that is exactly why we carry gyro as an independent witness.
 *
 * Pure logic. No Android imports, no coroutines, jvmTarget 11. [evaluate] is
 * fully STATELESS — every input (including the washboard event-rate) is passed
 * in. Rolling state (gyro peaks, recent event rate) is maintained by the caller,
 * by design, so this class stays trivially unit-testable against the labeled
 * test set (R-DET-7).
 *
 * Every threshold here is PROVISIONAL and WILL be tuned against the labeled
 * test-drive set (R-DET-7, G-1..G-4). They are named consts precisely so tuning
 * is a one-line edit per knob, not a logic rewrite.
