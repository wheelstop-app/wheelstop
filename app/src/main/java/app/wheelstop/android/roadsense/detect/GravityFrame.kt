/**
 * Converts raw `-iner` accelerometer samples into a **vertical residual**
 * `a_vert` — the signal the detector actually keys on.
 *
 * Why this exists (F-005, F-008): the head-unit IMU is mounted ~9.2° off true
 * vertical, so raw `aZ` is not "up" — it mixes gravity with cornering/braking
 * horizontal g. We can't use TYPE_GRAVITY/LINEAR_ACCELERATION (fusion sensors
 * built on the stub accel, F-004), so we estimate gravity ourselves:
 *
 *   ĝ  = low-pass(accel)                      (the gravity unit vector, device frame)
 *   a_vert = dot(accel, ĝ) − |g|              (pure vertical residual, tilt-corrected)
 *
 * `a_vert` ≈ 0 on flat road, swings ±several m/s² on a bump/pothole. The 9.2°
 * tilt is corrected automatically because ĝ is *measured*, not assumed to be Z.
 *
 * Production note (vs the probe's whole-drive mean): ĝ is a SLOW exponential
 * moving average so it tracks slow attitude changes (hills, remount) but does
 * NOT absorb fast bump transients. Time constant ≈ several seconds.
 *
 * Pure math, no Android deps — unit-testable. Not thread-safe; the owning
 * service feeds it from a single sensor thread.
