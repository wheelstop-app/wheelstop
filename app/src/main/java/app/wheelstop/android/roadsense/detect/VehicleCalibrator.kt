/**
 * Silent, per-vehicle suspension auto-calibration (R-EXT-1, D-014).
 *
 * The same physical bump produces a different vertical jolt in a soft SUV vs a
 * stiff sedan. To make severity a property of the ROAD (not the car), the
 * SeverityClassifier divides the measured impulse by a per-vehicle `vehicleScale`
 * (1.0 = reference vehicle). This class LEARNS that scale continuously from
 * normal driving — no "calibrate now" chore (D-014).
 *
 * ## How it learns
 * On smooth road the vertical residual `a_vert` is just suspension/tyre/road
 * texture noise. Its running RMS over quiet stretches is the vehicle's
 * **baseline roughness response** — a soft car rides floaty (higher baseline),
 * a stiff car transmits more (also higher) … so baseline alone is ambiguous.
 * What we actually want is how the car AMPLIFIES input relative to the reference,
 * which we approximate from the quiet-road residual RMS scaled to a reference
 * RMS. This is a deliberately simple, robust proxy — PROVISIONAL, to be refined
 * against the labeled set; the structure (continuous, quiet-gated, slow EMA) is
 * the deliverable, not the exact transfer model.
 *
 * Only quiet samples feed the estimate — bumps/potholes/events must NOT pollute
 * the baseline, so the caller passes `inEvent` (true while EventDetector is mid
 * event) and we skip those. We also skip when stationary/parked (no road input).
 *
 * ## Maturity
 * `maturity` (0..1) reflects how much quiet driving we've absorbed. It starts at
 * 0 (→ low confidence per D-015, and a red calibration indicator on the overlay,
 * R-OVL-1), climbs toward 1 as samples accumulate, and gates how much we trust
 * `vehicleScale` (we blend from 1.0 toward the learned scale by maturity).
 *
 * Pure, no Android, single-threaded (daemon RoadSense thread). EMA-based → O(1)
 * memory, no buffers.

     * DEFINITION (revised — issue E fix, Session 30f): maturity is the EMA's
     * CONVERGENCE FRACTION `1 − (1−α)^N`, not a linear `N / 60_000`. WHY: the baseline
     * RMS is an exponential moving average with weight [emaAlpha]≈0.001, so it is
     * statistically converged after a few TIME CONSTANTS (~1/α ≈ 1000 quiet samples
     * each): ~63% at 1 k, ~86% at 2 k, ~95% at 3 k. Requiring 60 k samples to call it
     * "mature" was meaningless — the estimate stopped moving long before — and on urban
     * roads (only a small fraction of samples pass the quiet gate) 60 k took HOURS, so
     * the overlay sat RED ("Learning your vehicle") essentially forever and confidence
     * stayed pinned at the CALIB_FLOOR (issue E: "calibrating forever"). Tying maturity
     * to the actual convergence of the thing it measures is the honest signal: ORANGE
     * ("improving") by ~415 quiet samples, GREEN ("calibrated", ≥0.67) at ~1108 — roughly
     * one normal drive — and the per-vehicle [vehicleScale] blends in on the SAME
     * schedule, so a real ~9% per-car scale starts correcting severity within a drive
     * instead of never.
     *
     * [maturitySamples] is retained only as the legacy linear scale (and the restore
     * cap); it no longer gates the convergence curve. ALPHA_CONVERGENCE mirrors
     * [emaAlpha] so the curve matches the estimator it describes.
