/**
 * SOTA temporal multi-sensor evidence-fusion classifier (D-038) — the answer to "make the
 * detector PRECISE on its own" (the user can't confirm/correct hazards while driving, so the
 * algorithm must stand alone) and to the user's physical model:
 *
 *   "slow down (brake) → gyro pitches UP then DOWN → speed recovers"  ⇒ SPEED BREAKER
 *   "gyro pitches DOWN then UP (drop into the hole, then climb out)"   ⇒ POTHOLE
 *
 * ## Why a fusion layer (not a new trigger)
 * Verified on 235 on-device labels: instantaneous AMPLITUDE cannot separate a real hazard from
 * a one-off false-positive thud, nor breaker from pothole — every amplitude/shape cut traded
 * false-alarms for genuine slow/gentle hazards ~1:1. The separating signal lives in (a) the
 * GYRO PITCH COUPLET (a real transverse feature pitches the body in a clean two-lobe sequence;
 * a lane seam / manhole / driver jolt does not), and (b) the BEHAVIORAL ENVELOPE around the
 * jolt (decelerate → cross → recover = a navigated hazard; a jolt at steady cruise with no
 * such envelope is far more likely noise). So this stays a TRIGGER → CLASSIFY split: the
 * [EventDetector] still finds the jolt; this fuses the surrounding evidence into a verdict.
 *
 * ## Soft fusion, not a hard AND-chain
 * [realnessScore] is a weighted sum of INDEPENDENT, each-normalized-to-[0,1] evidence terms,
 * minus a driver-artifact penalty. A pothole hit at steady speed (no brake/recover envelope)
 * still passes on pitch-couplet + biphasic alone — graceful degradation, never a brittle gate.
 *
 * ## Pitch-sign self-calibration
 * The signed pitch axis (GravityFrame.pitchRate) has an ambiguous absolute sign on a tilted
 * mount, so the breaker/pothole ORDER (+,− vs −,+) is only usable once we know which way is
 * "nose-up". We learn it ZERO-CONFIG from physics: during a confident braking event the nose
 * pitches DOWN, so the sign of pitchRate then anchors the convention ([PitchSignCalibrator]).
 * Until anchored, the couplet contributes magnitude/realness only, never a signed type vote —
 * exactly the "flat-highway cold start" fallback.
 *
 * ## Primary accept/type gate (D-040)
 * The controller's finalizeClassification runs [classify] on each completed event's full
 * ±window and uses [Verdict.accept] as THE store gate and [Verdict.type] as the authoritative
 * breaker/pothole call (SeverityClassifier supplies only severity/confidence). The weights +
 * [REALNESS_ACCEPT] remain PROVISIONAL physics-seeded priors — to be fit (logistic regression)
 * on the trustworthy (auto_accepted=0) label set; until then they're principled, not measured.
 *
 * Pure: no Android, no clock, no mutable shared state in [classify] (the sign calibrator is a
 * separate stateful helper the caller owns). Allocation-light; called once per completed event.
 * Every constant is PROVISIONAL — physics-seeded priors, to be fit (logistic regression) on the
 * trustworthy (auto_accepted=0) label set once available.
