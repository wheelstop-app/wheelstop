/**
 * Daemon-side [ImuStream]: the receiver end of the app→daemon IMU pipe (D-023).
 *
 * Unlike an app-side sensor stream, this one has no SensorManager — samples
 * arrive already decoded (the controller hands it the lists pulled off an
 * `IMU_BATCH` IPC frame via [ImuFrameCodec]). So [start]/[stop] here are
 * bookkeeping only (track whether we're meant to be live, for stall
 * detection); the actual data motion is [feed].
 *
 * Why implement [ImuStream] at all if it's just fed? Because the pipeline
 * (GravityFrame → EventDetector …) consumes an `ImuStream.Listener` and must not
 * know which side produced the samples. Same interface app-side, daemon-side, and
 * in replay tests — that's the whole point of the seam (D-023).
 *
 * Threading: [feed] is called on the IPC reader thread (one batch at a time, the
 * IPC server is one-line-per-connection). It forwards synchronously to the
 * listener, so the pipeline runs on that thread. That's intentional and matches
 * the single-threaded contract of GravityFrame/EventDetector — there is exactly
 * one feeder. Do not call [feed] from multiple threads concurrently.
