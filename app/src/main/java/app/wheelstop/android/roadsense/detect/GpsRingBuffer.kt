/**
 * Short rolling history of vehicle [Pose]s, used to place a detected hazard at
 * the position the car ACTUALLY was when the event happened — not where GPS
 * reported it a beat later (R-EXT-2).
 *
 * ## Why back-projection is necessary
 * Automotive GPS lags true position by ~0.5–1.5 s (receiver + fusion delay). The
 * IMU event timestamp (`DetectionCandidate.tMs`) is, by contrast, essentially
 * real-time. If we localized a bump at "the latest GPS fix", every hazard would
 * land 10–20 m past its true spot at speed — the difference between a usable map
 * and a useless one. So we:
 *   1. keep a few seconds of recent fixes here,
 *   2. when an event fires at `tEventMs`, look up where the car was at
 *      `tEventMs − fixLatencyMs`, interpolating between the two bracketing fixes.
 *
 * ## Fix-latency
 * `fixLatencyMs` is the GPS pipeline delay. It can be a fixed estimate (default
 * ~700 ms) or, better, estimated per-session by cross-correlating GPS speed with
 * the zero-latency BYD wheel speed (`BydVehicleData.speedKmh`) — that calibration
 * is a separate concern; this buffer just consumes whatever latency it's told.
 *
 * Fixed-size primitive-ish ring (array of Pose refs, head/count), no per-add
 * allocation beyond the caller's Pose. Not thread-safe — the daemon feeds GPS
 * and queries on its own single RoadSense thread. Pure (no Android, no clock).
