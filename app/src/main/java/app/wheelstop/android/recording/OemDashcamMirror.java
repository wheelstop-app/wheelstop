/**
 * Bridge between the pano dashcam recording lifecycle (RecordingModeManager)
 * and the OEM Dashcam pipeline.
 *
 * <p>Three modes the user picks on recording.html → OEM tab:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code off}        — never start the OEM mirror.</li>
 *   <li>{@code continuous} — record dvr_*.mp4 the whole time the pipeline
 *                            is up, independent of pano dashcam state.</li>
 *   <li>{@code smart}      — mirror whatever the pano dashcam is doing.
 *                            Pano starts → OEM starts; pano stops → OEM
 *                            stops. dvr_*.mp4 stays aligned with cam_*.mp4
 *                            without the user managing two settings.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class only handles the {@code recordingMode} side. The {@code
 * surveillanceMode} side fires from {@code SurveillanceEngineGpu} via the
 * existing OEM-event hooks.
