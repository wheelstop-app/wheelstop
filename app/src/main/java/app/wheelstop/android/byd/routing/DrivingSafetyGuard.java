/**
 * Decides whether a motion-sensitive vehicle action is safe to run right now.
 *
 * <p>Split into a pure decision function ({@link #isBlocked}) and a live wrapper
 * ({@link #isMovementBlocked()}), mirroring {@code roadsense.source.VehicleStateGate} —
 * keeping the policy pure means it's unit-testable without Android/HAL dependencies,
 * which matters because mis-gating here means either a false sense of safety (allowed
 * when it shouldn't be) or breaking normal parked remote control (blocked when it
 * shouldn't be).
 *
 * <p>Callers ask only the raw fact ({@code isMovementBlocked(): boolean}) — this class
 * knows nothing about {@link VehicleCommandRouter.VehicleCommand} or risk tiers, so it
 * can gate both the router's dispatch path and the unrelated screen/media endpoints in
 * {@code VehicleControlApiHandler} without either needing to know about the other.
