 * leg needs — and the router resolves the effective policy from the
 * declaration plus a per-command override under the {@code bydCloud.routePolicy}
 * config section. The result of every dispatch is a structured
 * {@link CommandResult} so callers can render a transparent
 * "sent via cloud" / "sent via direct connection" badge to the UI.
 *
 * <p>Cloud calls run on a single-thread executor with a 30 s budget so a

 * in flight at a time — concurrent /control/remoteControl posts trip BYD's
 * rate-limit (response code 6024).
