/**
 * Interior-ambient (atmosphere) light state as a capturable, applicable bundle — the
 * ambient half of a saved position, alongside {@link BodyworkSeatProbe}'s geometry.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is modelled on how BYD's own ambient screen
 * ({@code Di4IviAmbientLightFragment}) drives the HAL, because that screen is the
 * definition of "what the car is set to" and a capture that disagrees with it is
 * wrong by construction:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Zones are real and independent.</b> {@code setIALColor}/{@code setIALBrightness}
 *       take the area as their first argument and the car stores a separate value per
 *       zone. Area 1 = front, 2 = rear. Area 3 ("all rows") is a UI convenience that
 *       writes both, and is NOT readable — asking for area 3 returns a HAL error, which
 *       is why reads here only ever ask for 1 and 2.</li>
 *   <li><b>Brightness is a 0..5 level, not a percentage.</b> BYD's slider max is 5 and
 *       the value goes to the HAL unscaled, so a level captured here re-applies exactly.
 *       {@code BydDataCollector}'s percent-based API converts, which is right for a user
 *       typing a percentage and wrong for a round-trip.</li>
 *   <li><b>The colour count varies by trim</b> ({@code SET_IAL_COLOR_CONFIG} selects 6,
 *       30, 63 or 126). The bound is read rather than assumed, so a car with a bigger
 *       palette is not silently clamped to someone else's range.</li>
 *   <li><b>The star-ring zone is not implemented on this firmware.</b> Its feature ids
 *       exist, but BYD's own accessor has a "to be added" placeholder branch where the
 *       read should be. Not captured; it would only ever record a zero.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Modes matter for apply ORDER, not just content. Music mode and dynamic colours both
 * drive the colour continuously, so applying a fixed colour while either is on means the
 * car overwrites it immediately. Apply therefore turns the modes off first, writes the
 * static state, and only then restores whichever modes the position actually wants.
