/**
 * Shared one-shot upgrade of a stored credential field from the LEGACY
 * firmware-fingerprint-bound key to the STABLE device-id-only key, so a future
 * OTA can't strand it (see {@link CredentialCipher}). Used by the Telegram bot
 * token, the BYD-cloud password, and the NavMap routing key.
 *
 * <p>Two correctness guards, both learned from the Telegram-token fix:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Single-key delta:</b> writes ONLY the upgraded key via
 *       {@link UnifiedConfigManager#updateSection}, never the whole
 *       (read-earlier, now-stale) section. updateSection merges per-key under
 *       its cross-process file lock, so a concurrent clear/rotate of OTHER keys
 *       in the same section is preserved (no resurrect of a just-cleared
 *       username/enabled flag).</li>
 *   <li><b>Compare-and-set:</b> re-reads the field FRESH (cross-UID
 *       forceReload) immediately before writing and bails if it changed since
 *       the upgrade was computed — so a concurrent clear/rotate of the SAME
 *       field isn't resurrected.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Best-effort and idempotent: a no-op once the field is stable (or absent,
 * or unrecoverable), never throws into the caller.
 *
 * @return true iff an upgrade write actually committed.
