/**
 * MANAGER-LEVEL access channel to the BYD HAL — a fallback for reads that the per-device path
 * cannot satisfy, plus the device-activation call we never made.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> We reach the HAL exactly one way: {@code Device.getInstance(ctx)} then
 * {@code device.get(int[] featureIds, Class type)}. Two independently-built reference apps use additional
 * channels, verified by bytecode inspection on 2026-07-29:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>reference app A</b> (its telemetry bridge) calls
 *       {@code enableDevice(...)} on {@code BYDAutoDeviceManager} for every telemetry device it
 *       polls, and reads through the manager's own {@code getDouble(deviceType, featureId)}.
 *       It calls BOTH enable shapes — {@code manager.enableDevice(IBYDAutoDevice)} and
 *       {@code BYDAutoManager.enableDevice(int deviceType)}.</li>
 *   <li><b>reference app B</b> (its device-init layer) resolves a
 *       device through a THREE-tier ladder — {@code DeviceManager.getInstance(ctx).getDevice(type)}
 *       → per-device {@code getInstance(ctx)} → raw {@code getConstructor(Context).newInstance} —
 *       and resolves {@code getDouble} alongside {@code get} up front.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The symptom that motivated it.</b> On a BEV capture (log_F2ZQH7CC, 2026-07-29) the entire
 * charging-power surface read NaN simultaneously — {@code getChargePower},
 * {@code getExternalChargingPower}, {@code getChargingPower} AND cluster feature id
 * {@code 0x32300018}. Four independent getters failing in lockstep points at an un-activated or
 * unresolved device handle far more than at four separate HAL bugs. This class tests that
 * hypothesis with data instead of argument.
 *
 * <p><b>Design constraints (deliberate, do not "simplify"):</b>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Purely additive.</b> Nothing here runs unless the existing path already returned
 *       nothing. A trim that works today takes byte-identical code paths, so this cannot regress
 *       a working vehicle — the same containment rule as invariant I1.</li>
 *   <li><b>Every probe is one-shot and cached, including FAILURE.</b> The HAL is a binder; a
 *       reflective miss costs a thrown exception. Retrying a known-absent method on every 5 s poll
 *       would burn CPU for nothing, so negative results are cached too
 *       (see {@link #missCache}).</li>
 *   <li><b>Never throws.</b> Every entry point returns a sentinel (NaN / MIN_VALUE / false) and
 *       swallows {@code Throwable}, because callers sit on the collector's hot path.</li>
 *   <li><b>One-shot INFO logging per outcome.</b> A per-poll log would be ~1440 lines/day; the
 *       question this answers ("which channel works on this trim?") is answered once.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>WHERE THE DIAGNOSTICS ARE VISIBLE — read before asking for a capture.</b> The one-shot
 * lines below are the entire payoff of this class, and in the {@code release} (alpha) variant they
 * are stripped THREE ways over: the Gradle auto-detect adds {@code proguard-rules-strip-logs.pro}
 * (R8 deletes the {@code info()}/{@code debug()} calls outright),
 * {@code proguard-rules-strip-console.pro} is always applied, and this tag is not in
 * {@code DaemonLogConfig.ENABLED_TAGS} by default. They appear in full in a <b>braveheart</b> build
 * ({@code LOG_CAPTURE=true}, no stripping), or in {@code release} by setting
 * {@code DaemonLogConfig.BYD_TELEMETRY = true}, which both keeps the calls and opens the tag.
 * Asking an alpha customer for these lines without one of those two things yields nothing.
