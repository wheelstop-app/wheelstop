/**
 * Casts an arbitrary installed app onto the BYD driver-cluster (fission) display
 * for the "Move app to display → cluster" automation / key-mapping action.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this is not a bare {@code am start --display 1}.</b> On this firmware the
 * cluster display does NOT exist until the OEM projection is opened: the fission
 * {@code VirtualDisplay} is created by the projection open-sequence (size-profile →
 * fullscreen-on → Di4 mode) that {@link ClusterProjectionController} owns, and
 * SurfaceFlinger assigns its logical id per-open (it is NOT reliably 1 — on some trims
 * display 1 is the HEAD UNIT). A raw {@code --display 1} therefore either lands on
 * nothing or clobbers the infotainment screen. This mirrors the proven
 * {@code ClusterMapProjector} flow: acquire the projection as a sustained holder, wait
 * for the live fission display id to materialise, then {@code am start --display <id>
 * --windowingMode 1} the target app onto it. The gauge-restore safety net
 * (forceClose on ACC-off / disable / SIGTERM) is entirely inside the controller and is
 * unaffected by this class.
 *
 * <p><b>Difference from the map cast.</b> The map is OUR cooperative Activity (a
 * dedicated cluster alias that self-finishes off a UCM flag and is kept alive by a
 * daemon watchdog). A third-party app is NOT cooperative: the daemon (uid 2000) cannot
 * {@code finish()} a foreign uid-1000 Activity, and a non-touch 1920×720 panel offers
 * no way for the user to dismiss it. So this class deliberately does NOT run a
 * keep-alive watchdog or a self-finish handshake — it launches once (with a short
 * resume-verify + retry, since {@code am start} exits on ACCEPT not RESUMED) and holds
 * the projection open under the {@code "castapp"} token until {@link #stop()} (moving
 * back to the head unit, an explicit stop action, or ACC-off) releases it and the
 * controller restores the gauges. Holding open is what keeps the cast app visible; a
 * swipe-away simply leaves the projection showing whatever the OEM puts there until
 * stop, which is the safest non-cooperative behaviour (never repaints a ghost).
 *
 * <p>Runs the wait+launch off the caller's thread (the HTTP worker), exactly like the
 * map projector, so a slow projection open never blocks the request.
