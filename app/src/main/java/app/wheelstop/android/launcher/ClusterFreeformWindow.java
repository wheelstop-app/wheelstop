/**
 * Puts a cast app into FREEFORM windowing at explicit bounds on the driver-cluster
 * ("fission") display and resizes it in place — the mechanism that lets the Projection
 * screen's box actually shrink/move the app ON the cluster. All work is
 * {@code IActivityTaskManager} reflection from the daemon (uid 2000 / shell, targetSdk 25 so
 * hidden-API exempt), the same privileged surface the reference cluster-cast app uses.
 *
 * <h3>Why the old three-call sequence silently did nothing</h3>
 * The previous implementation issued {@code setTaskResizeable} →
 * {@code setTaskWindowingMode(FREEFORM)} → {@code resizeTask(bounds)} and reported success as
 * soon as the reflected methods DISPATCHED — it returned {@code freeform && sized} where both
 * flags meant only "no exception escaped", never "AMS honoured it".
 *
 * <p>The decisive detail, from the platform source
 * ({@code ActivityTaskManagerService.resizeTask}, android-29 line 3217):
 * <pre>
 *   if (!task.getWindowConfiguration().canResizeTask())
 *       throw new IllegalArgumentException("resizeTask not allowed on task=" + task);
 * </pre>
 * and {@code WindowConfiguration.canResizeTask()} is literally
 * {@code mWindowingMode == WINDOWING_MODE_FREEFORM}. So {@code resizeTask} <b>throws</b> unless
 * the task is ALREADY in freeform. If the preceding mode change did not actually take — and on a
 * cluster VirtualDisplay that does not advertise freeform support, {@code getOrCreateStack(
 * WINDOWING_MODE_FREEFORM, …)} can fail to move it — then the resize threw
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException}, the old code swallowed it at {@code debug} level, and
 * {@code applyBounds} STILL returned true. Nothing moved, nothing was reported: the exact
 * no-error/no-movement symptom.
 *
 * <p><b>And one layer deeper.</b> Getting the task INTO freeform is itself gated:
 * {@code ActivityDisplay.isWindowingModeSupported} has
 * {@code if (!supportsFreeform && windowingMode == WINDOWING_MODE_FREEFORM) return false;}, where
 * {@code supportsFreeform} is {@code hasSystemFeature(FEATURE_FREEFORM_WINDOW_MANAGEMENT) ||
 * Settings.Global.enable_freeform_support != 0}. A car head unit ships neither by default, so the
 * mode change is silently resolved away and the resize then throws. See
 * {@link #ensureFreeformSupportEnabled()} — note AMS caches that setting at boot, so enabling it
 * only takes effect after a restart. This is why an honest {@code applied=false} matters: on such a
 * build the feature genuinely cannot work yet, and the log says so instead of pretending.
 *
 * <p><b>What does NOT work (verified, do not re-add).</b>
 * {@code setTaskWindowingModeSplitScreenPrimary(taskId, createMode, toTop, animate, bounds,
 * showRecents)} looks like an atomic "mode + bounds" setter and the reference calls it, but on this
 * AMS its 2nd parameter is a {@code SPLIT_SCREEN_CREATE_MODE_*} (0 = TOP_OR_LEFT, 1 =
 * BOTTOM_OR_RIGHT) — <b>not</b> a windowing mode — and the target mode is hard-coded to
 * {@code SPLIT_SCREEN_PRIMARY} ({@code ActivityTaskManagerService:2673-2707}). It can never produce
 * FREEFORM; at best it docks the cast app into split-screen on the cluster. Likewise
 * {@code setStackWindowingMode}/{@code setActivityStackWindowingMode} do not exist on API 29 at all
 * (the only stack-level entry points are {@code moveTaskToStack}/{@code moveStackToDisplay}), so
 * that rung is a no-op there and is kept only for builds that do expose it.
 *
 * <h3>Escalation ladder (each rung is best-effort; verification decides the verdict)</h3>
 * <pre>
 *   resolve taskId (display-scoped)  →  ensureFreeformSupportEnabled()
 *   setTaskResizeable(taskId, FORCE_RESIZEABLE)
 *   [stack rungs, only where they exist AND the stack holds no other task — see Safety]
 *       setStackWindowingMode(stackId, FREEFORM)   // absent on API 29
 *       resizeStack(stackId, bounds, …)
 *   setTaskWindowingMode(taskId, FREEFORM, true)   // THE call that matters — must precede resize
 *   resizeTask(taskId, bounds, RESIZE_MODE_USER)   // throws unless already FREEFORM
 *   setFocusedRootTask/setFocusedTask(taskId)   // the latter on API 29
 *   verify getTaskBounds(taskId) ≈ bounds  →  else shell `cmd activity task resize`
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Why NOT {@code am start --windowingMode 5}</h3>
 * Bare freeform-at-launch drops the app into AMS's DEFAULT freeform rect
 * ({@code Rect(825,0-1095,720)} — the "small projection" symptom) and can leave the task in a
 * dirty state. The reliable path is: launch NORMALLY (fullscreen, the proven {@link ClusterCast}
 * path), let it RESUME, then convert the live task with bounds attached. Resizing later is the
 * same call on the already-running task (no relaunch, no flicker).
 *
 * <h3>Safety — this cannot disturb the nav-map or blind-spot</h3>
 * Everything here is scoped to the CAST APP's OWN task, identified by package <b>AND</b> display:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Display scoping is the primary guard</b> ({@link #findTaskIdViaAtm}). Matching on
 *       package alone is NOT sufficient, because a package can own tasks on several displays at
 *       once — and {@code com.overdrive.app} is itself a launchable package that owns the head-unit
 *       UI task AND the nav-map cluster task ({@code .navmap.RoadSenseClusterMapActivity}). An
 *       unscoped lookup could therefore return the MAP's task and hand its stack to the resize
 *       ladder. Every resolve is pinned to the cast's own fission display
 *       ({@code ClusterCast.castDisplayId}); a package match on any OTHER display is REFUSED, and
 *       a resize is REFUSED outright while that display is still unresolved (rather than falling
 *       back to an unscoped lookup). The reference scopes by display for the same reason.</li>
 *   <li>We deliberately do NOT port the reference's display-level verbs
 *       ({@code setDisplayToSingleTaskInstance}, {@code cleanFissionStacks},
 *       {@code moveTaskToDisplay}) — those reconfigure the SHARED cluster display and are
 *       exactly what could corrupt a co-resident map/blind-spot projection.</li>
 *   <li>The stack rungs are additionally gated on the stack being <b>exclusively ours</b>
 *       ({@link #exclusiveStackIdForTask}): if the resolved task's stack hosts any other task we
 *       SKIP them and rely on the task-level calls. Stricter than the reference, which
 *       drives the stack unconditionally.</li>
 *   <li>Blind-spot is a SurfaceControl LAYER (no task at all — structurally immune).</li>
 *   <li>Belt-and-braces: the cast picker itself filters OverDrive out of the app list
 *       ({@code VehicleControlApiHandler.handleClusterApps}), so a self-cast cannot normally be
 *       requested in the first place.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Every call is individually guarded: a missing method or denied reflection returns false and
 * the caller simply keeps the app fullscreen (the pre-existing behaviour).
