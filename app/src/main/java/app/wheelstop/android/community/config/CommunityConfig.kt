/**
 * Typed accessor for the `community` section of [UnifiedConfigManager] — config for
 * the Community Automations sharing feature (browse/publish shared automations via
 * the open-source `community-edge/` Cloudflare Worker + D1 backend).
 *
 * Mirrors [app.wheelstop.android.roadsense.config.RoadSenseConfig]: a feature-owned
 * wrapper over UCM's PUBLIC generic API (`loadConfig()`/`forceReload()` to read,
 * `updateSection()` to merge-write) so it never touches UCM source, and the section
 * is file-backed so both the app UID (web settings writes) and the daemon UID
 * (handler reads) see the same values. Daemon reads that need the very latest
 * app-written value pass `forceReload=true` (cross-UID staleness — see
 * feedback_unified_config_force_reload).
 *
 * ## Identity is SHARED with RoadSense — not minted twice
 * The anonymous rotating device UUID lives in the `roadSense` section
 * ([app.wheelstop.android.roadsense.sync.DeviceId], key `deviceId`). Community reuses it
 * via `DeviceId.current(nowMs)` so the two crowdsource features share ONE identity
 * instead of creating a second. This section therefore holds only the community
 * worker URL + the remembered author display name.
 *
 * All fields have safe defaults so a missing/partial section never crashes a read.

     * non-daemon process `updateSection` reroutes the write to the daemon over IPC. Holding the
     * lock here and then waiting on a daemon that must acquire the same lock to serve us would
     * deadlock until the IPC read timeout. Only the shell daemon (which writes locally) may
     * take it; anywhere else we do the unlocked read-modify-write, which is exactly the
     * pre-existing behaviour and at worst loses a dedupe hint. This handler currently runs
     * only in the daemon (HttpServer lives in CameraDaemon), so the locked path is the live
     * one — the gate exists so reaching it from the app process degrades instead of hanging.
