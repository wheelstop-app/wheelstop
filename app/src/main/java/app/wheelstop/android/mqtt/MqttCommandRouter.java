/**
 * Per-connection ingress for Home Assistant control commands.
 *
 * Takes an inbound {@code (entityKey, subKey, payload)} parsed from a
 * {@code <base>/<key>[/<sub>]/set} topic, resolves it against
 * {@link VehicleControlCatalog}, and dispatches the resulting command
 * <b>SDK-only by default</b> via {@link VehicleCommandRouter#executeSdkOnly}. A narrow
 * command-level opt-in uses the normal SDK-first router path when its cloud fallback is
 * semantically safe. On success it echoes command-only controls to their retained state topic.
 * Controls with a readable backend, such as charge limits, publish only their verified readback
 * rather than the requested value.
 *
 * Commands run on a dedicated single-thread executor so the Paho callback thread
 * (which delivers {@code messageArrived}) is never blocked by a 1–2 s HAL round-trip.
 * Tailgate STOP uses a separate urgent worker so it can cancel an in-flight cloud OPEN without
 * waiting behind that request in the normal per-connection queue.
