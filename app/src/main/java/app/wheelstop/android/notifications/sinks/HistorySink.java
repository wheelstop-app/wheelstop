/**
 * Persistence sink — writes every {@link NotificationEvent} to the
 * {@link NotificationStore} so the Notifications ▸ Log tab has a durable history
 * to browse, filter, and delete.
 *
 * <p>Subscribed FIRST (before LogSink / PushSink / TelegramSink) in
 * {@code CameraDaemon.initNotifications()} so it receives the NotificationBus
 * pre-subscribe buffer flush — the bus replays boot-window events only to the
 * first sink that subscribes, and those edges (a door opened / charging fault
 * during startup) are exactly what a user expects to find in the log.
 *
 * <p>Because it sits on the bus (not at the ~13 individual publisher sites),
 * EVERY notification — surveillance, proximity, tyre, door, charging, SOH,
 * test — is captured with no per-source change. Dispatch is already off the
 * caller thread (NotificationBus uses a single-thread executor), and the
 * store's insert is fully guarded, so this sink adds no latency to the
 * publisher.
