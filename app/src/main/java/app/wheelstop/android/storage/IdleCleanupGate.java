/**
 * Decision state machine for the periodic cleanup's IDLE gate.
 *
 * <p>Extracted from StorageManager's tick so the gate semantics — dirty
 * generation, compare-before-clear, hourly backstop, lazy low-disk probe —
 * are unit-testable in isolation (audit: no focused tests covered the
 * dirty-generation races). Pure Java, no Android dependencies.
 *
 * <p><b>Contract.</b> Mutation paths call {@link #markDirty()}; the idle tick
 * calls {@link #evaluate} to decide whether a full cleanup pass may be
 * skipped, and — when a pass runs — {@link #onPassComplete} with the
 * generation the pass STARTED with. Compare-before-clear: the generation is
 * only marked clean if nothing bumped it while the pass ran, so a file save
 * landing mid-pass leaves the gate dirty and the next tick re-runs. Losing
 * that race the other way would silently skip a needed reap until the
 * backstop.
 *
 * <p><b>Ordering caveat.</b> A marker must call {@link #markDirty()} AFTER
 * (or atomically with) making its mutation visible to the reaper's
 * measurement — the pass that observes the bump must be able to observe the
 * bytes. Every current caller (save hooks, setters, mount transitions)
 * satisfies this trivially by bumping after the filesystem/config write.
 *
 * <p>Thread-safety: markDirty is safe from any thread; evaluate /
 * onPassComplete are only ever called from the single-threaded cleanup
 * scheduler, so the volatile fields need no CAS.
