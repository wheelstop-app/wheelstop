/**
 * Decision logic for the internal→external mid-session recording migration.
 *
 * <p><b>The bug this closes.</b> Recordings are configured for an external
 * volume (SD/USB) but the volume mounts asynchronously — at ACC-ON the RMM
 * activation frequently wins the race, {@code resolveActive} silently falls
 * back to internal, and the {@code cam_*} session opens on internal storage.
 * From that point the session is path-latched: segment rotation derives every
 * next segment from the session's base path, and
 * {@code updateActiveDirectories()} deliberately skips the recordings-dir
 * swap while a recording is active. The volume watchdog's SUCCESS branch
 * pushes a one-shot {@code setOutputDir} override, but that override is only
 * consumed at the next {@code startRecording()} — and for a HEALTHY session
 * nothing restarts the recording ({@code resyncFromHardware} short-circuits
 * on a healthy pipeline), so the whole drive lands on internal. The unmount
 * direction (external→internal) and the user-initiated storage-type switch
 * both already force a stop+restart; the mount direction was the missing
 * symmetric case.
 *
 * <p><b>Contract.</b> {@link #evaluate} answers: "the configured external
 * recordings volume just came online — should we finalize the current
 * segment and roll the session over to it?" It is pure (no Android, no I/O)
 * so the gate order and path comparison are pinned by plain JUnit tests. The
 * caller (StorageManager's post-mount hook) maps live state into the
 * parameters and acts only on {@link Decision#MIGRATE}:
 * {@code setOutputDir(external)} → {@code pipeline.stopRecording()} →
 * forced RMM reactivation.
 *
 * <p><b>Why each gate exists:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code configuredTargetCameOnline} — the volume that came online must
 *       be the CONFIGURED recordings target. A USB insert while recordings
 *       are configured for SD (or internal) must not touch the session.</li>
 *   <li>{@code pipelineInNormalRecordingMode} — the recorder is SHARED with
 *       surveillance event clips. While the pipeline is in SURVEILLANCE mode
 *       an SD remount must never finalize a parked sentry event mid-write
 *       (surveillance has its own live {@code setEventOutputDir} push).</li>
 *   <li>{@code sessionOwnedByRecordingMode} — only CONTINUOUS / DRIVE_MODE
 *       sessions are restartable by RMM. A manual {@code /api/start} session
 *       (RMM mode NONE) or a proximity event clip would be STOPPED but never
 *       RESTARTED by the forced reactivation — stopping them here would be
 *       data loss, and proximity clips re-resolve their directory per event
 *       anyway.</li>
 *   <li>{@code recorderRecording} — nothing to migrate when idle; the next
 *       start resolves the live directory (or consumes the watchdog
 *       override) by itself.</li>
 *   <li>{@code activeOutputPath} under {@code internalRecordingsRoot} — the
 *       action fires only while the actual open file sits on the internal
 *       fallback. This is what makes the whole handler idempotent without
 *       extra hysteresis: after a successful migration the output is
 *       external, so a repeat edge (mount flap, duplicate discovery pass)
 *       evaluates to {@link Decision#SKIP_OUTPUT_NOT_ON_INTERNAL}. Note:
 *       compare against the encoder's ACTUAL output path, not
 *       {@code getActiveRecordingsStorageType()} — the active type flips to
 *       SD_CARD as soon as the volume is available even while the open file
 *       remains internal.</li>
 *   <li>{@code externalTargetRoot} resolved + writable — never redirect a
 *       live session onto a volume that did not actually resolve (or whose
 *       bounded write probe failed); losing the internal session for a dead
 *       target would be strictly worse than the bug. Writability is a LAZY
 *       supplier because it is an actual bounded touch-probe against the
 *       recordings directory (not a cheap flag read): it must run before
 *       anything is stopped, but only when every other gate has already
 *       passed — an idle or surveillance-owned tick must never pay (or
 *       block on) a disk probe.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Transient vs terminal skips.</b> The online edge is one-shot: nothing
 * re-fires it if the world becomes migratable a few seconds later. Directory
 * initialization for a freshly-mounted card commits AFTER the edge on the
 * discovery-driven paths and can take several seconds on a FUSE-bridged
 * volume — a single-shot evaluation would consume the edge, skip on the
 * not-yet-committed target, and strand the session on internal for the whole
 * drive. {@link #isRetryableSkip} therefore classifies which skips a
 * bounded retry loop may re-evaluate (state that can legitimately settle
 * within the edge's retry window) and which are terminal for the edge
 * (config says no, the session is not ours to restart, or the output is
 * already placed correctly — for those, later starts resolve the live
 * directory themselves).
