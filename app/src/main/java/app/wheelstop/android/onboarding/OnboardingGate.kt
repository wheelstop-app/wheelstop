/**
 * Parked-only safety gate for the onboarding overlay.
 *
 * SAFETY CONTRACT: no blocking/full-screen onboarding may appear while the car is
 * being driven. The overlay shows only when parked, and any visible overlay is
 * dismissed immediately on an ACC/ignition-ON edge.
 *
 * SIGNAL CHOICE — the BYD broadcast, NOT AccMonitor.isAccOn(). AccMonitor's static
 * accOn lives in the DAEMON process (uid 2000) and is only updated by AccSentryDaemon
 * IPC into that process; in this app UI process it sits at its false default forever,
 * so reading it here is meaningless. The proven app-process signal is the same vendor
 * broadcast PinLockActivity keys off to minimize the keypad on ignition: we listen for
 * the ON-specific actions only (com.byd.action.ACC_ON / IGN_ON), which carry an
 * unambiguous direction — unlike com.byd.accmode.ACC_MODE_CHANGED which fires on both
 * edges. We default to "assume parked" (show is allowed) because the overlay auto-runs
 * at foreground launch, which is overwhelmingly a parked moment, and we self-dismiss the
 * instant a real ACC-ON edge arrives.
 *
 * Lifecycle: construct, call [register] when the overlay attaches, [unregister] when it
 * detaches. [onAccOn] fires on the looper thread for the host to tear the overlay down.
