/**
 * Off-looper writer for the `statusOverlay` config section, shared by the
 * Settings screens' status-pill switches.
 *
 * Why this exists (audit Aug 2026):
 *  - [UnifiedConfigManager.updateSection] is documented off-UI-looper-only:
 *    an app-UID write does a blocking localhost IPC round-trip (1500ms
 *    connect + 5000ms read, plus reconcile retries) followed by a full JSON
 *    rewrite. The overlay switches used to call it straight from their
 *    checked-change listeners — the same ANR pattern SettingsSecurityFragment
 *    already routes through a dedicated executor
 *    (per memory feedback_no_unified_writes_on_ui_thread).
 *  - The write can legitimately return false (daemon unreachable AND the
 *    stable .lock inode not yet provisioned — app-UID local writes are
 *    deliberately deferred rather than truncation-prone). Callers previously
 *    ignored the boolean, so the switch stayed where the user put it while
 *    the config kept the old value: a silent no-op. Callers now receive the
 *    result on the main thread and revert the switch on failure, matching
 *    the RoadSense switch's existing revert-on-failure contract.
 *
 * One bounded retry: the daemon's IPC server rebinds within ~3s of a
 * transient bind failure, and a daemon restart is the most common reason for
 * a routed write to decline. A single delayed retry converts that whole
 * window from "toggle silently reverts" to "toggle just works", without
 * unbounded queuing.

     * until the daemon has provisioned the stable `.lock` inode — one that
     * legitimately returns false early after boot. With no retry the switch
     * just sprang back and RoadSense could not be enabled or disabled at all
