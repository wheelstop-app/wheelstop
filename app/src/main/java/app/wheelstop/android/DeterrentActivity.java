/**
 * Touch-capture companion to the daemon-side ScreenDeterrent.
 *
 * Why this exists: while ACC is off, BYD's vendor compositor excludes every
 * Window from HWC composition except its own AccAnimation layer at z=2^30.
 * That means an Activity launched in the app process is INVISIBLE during
 * ACC off — no matter what flags or content it sets. The daemon-side
 * SurfaceControl render at z=Integer.MAX_VALUE is what the user sees.
 *
 * What this Activity owns: input. Even though it's not composited, its
 * Window is the foreground task per WindowManager and its InputChannel sits
 * at the top of the input-dispatch stack. Tap-through-to-launcher is
 * suppressed because the dispatcher delivers events to this Activity first
 * — and we consume them all.
 *
 * Lifetime: launched by `am start` from byd_cam_daemon when motion is
 * confirmed. Polls UnifiedConfigManager every 500ms and finishes when:
 *   - screenDeterrentActiveUntilMs has elapsed, OR
 *   - screenDeterrentForceStop is true (ACC turned on), OR
 *   - screenDeterrentEnabled was toggled off mid-session, OR
 *   - the absolute safety bound (60s) was hit.
 *
 * Single-instance: re-launching while already running is a no-op (or routes
 * through onNewIntent — also a no-op for us). The deadline poll handles
 * sustained motion automatically.
