/**
 * Accumulates session energy from the vehicle's charged-energy counter, correctly across counter
 * WRAP, SATURATION and session RESET.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a plain {@code end - start} is not enough.</b> The counter is a 16-bit value at 1 Wh
 * resolution, so its full range is {@code [0, 65.534]} kWh. A single session can exceed that: a
 * 10→100% charge on a large pack (85-109 kWh nominal) delivers 75-98 kWh. At the ceiling the
 * counter either wraps back through zero or pins, and both cases make a naive difference
 * under-report by exactly the amount that overflowed — silently, and in currency.
 *
 * <p>So we integrate the counter's RISES instead of differencing its endpoints:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>rise</b> — add it.</li>
 *   <li><b>drop from near the ceiling to near zero</b> — a WRAP. Add the distance to the ceiling
 *       plus the new value. Only credited while the same session is still live, because a wrap
 *       cannot happen without energy flowing.</li>
 *   <li><b>pinned at the ceiling</b> — SATURATION. The counter has stopped counting, so it is no
 *       longer a measurement; the accumulator marks itself unreliable and the caller falls back.</li>
 *   <li><b>any other drop</b> — a session RESET (new session, or BMS re-init). The counter's own
 *       history is gone, so what came before cannot be recovered from it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The ambiguity that matters, and how it is resolved.</b> If the daemon is down while the
 * counter moves, we see only the endpoints and cannot tell a wrap from a reset: a baseline of 50
 * and a later reading of 10 is either "wrapped, 25.5 kWh added" or "reset, 10 kWh added". The
 * counter alone cannot say. So this class does not decide — it reports BOTH candidates and lets
 * the caller pick the one that agrees with an independent SOC-derived estimate. That is why the
 * SOC cross-check is load-bearing rather than a mere sanity net.
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe; the caller serialises on the sampler/session thread.
