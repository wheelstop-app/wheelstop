/**
 * Owns the fine-grained in-session sampler + config for Charging Analytics, and
 * exposes accessors used by {@link ChargingApiHandler}.
 *
 * <p>The discrete session edge INSERT/UPDATE (running-max peak, AC/DC, cost,
 * rollup) stays inside {@link SocHistoryDatabase#trackChargingSession} — it is
 * already driven on the 2-minute SoC sampler thread with the correct
 * {@code wasCharging} state. This manager adds ONLY:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A fast sampler (every {@code fastSampleSec}, default 12 s) that runs
 *       while {@link ChargingDetector#isCharging()} is true and writes
 *       {@code charging_power_samples} rows for true ramp curves.</li>
 *   <li>Registration as a {@link ChargingDetector.FusedStateListener} so the
 *       sampler starts/stops exactly on the fused charging edge (same truth
 *       source as the session edges — no divergence).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Edge-case guards (see project memory): the fast sampler skips ticks whose
 * power is NaN or ≤0 so an ACC-OFF read can't poison the curve; it uses the
 * charger-reported {@code ChargingStateData.chargingPowerKW} which is
 * ACC-independent during DC charging.
