/**
 * Daemon-side executor for physical-key mappings.
 *
 * The key interception itself lives in {@code KeepAliveAccessibilityService}
 * (onKeyEvent → {@code KeyMapDispatcher}), which runs in the <b>app</b> process
 * (UID 10xxx). BYD SDK actuation, however, only
 * clears the signature-permission wall from the <b>daemon</b> process (UID 2000),
 * which is where {@link VehicleCommandRouter} and {@link BydDataCollector} live.
 * So the a11y service does not actuate directly — it POSTs the bound action here
 * (via {@code DaemonHttpClient}, JWT-authenticated) and this handler runs it in
 * the daemon, identical to how {@link app.wheelstop.android.mqtt.MqttCommandRouter}
 * dispatches Home-Assistant control commands.
 *
 * Endpoints:
 *   GET  /api/keymap/config — { enabled, allowAdvanced, bindings[],
 *                               a11yEnabled, a11yBound, a11yPending,
 *                               restartRequired }
 *       a11yEnabled = OS bind PRECONDITION (listed + master-on, or in-proc).
 *       a11yBound   = service ACTUALLY bound/live (in-proc isRunning, or a live
 *                     ServiceRecord via dumpsys) — the honest "keys will fire" truth.
 *       a11yPending = precondition met but not yet bound (the transient enable-edge
 *                     window); the client can show "enabling…" and confirm the real
 *                     bind before hiding the nudge instead of trusting a11yEnabled.
 *   POST /api/keymap/config — persist { enabled, allowAdvanced, bindings[] };
 *                             response echoes { success, a11yEnabled, a11yBound,
 *                             a11yPending, restartRequired } (auto-enables the
 *                             service on the enable edge; never restarts camera).
 *   POST /api/keymap/fire  — body { kind, ... } → run one bound action
 *
 * Action kinds (mirror the settings UI's curated picker + advanced escape hatch):
 *   { "kind":"catalog", "key":"drl", "sub":null, "payload":"on" }
 *       Resolve against {@link VehicleControlCatalog} and executeSdkOnly — the
 *       full curated set (drl, sunroof, sunshade, windows_all, tailgate, seat_*,
 *       climate, charge_cap_*, child_lock, wireless_charging, adas_*).
 *   { "kind":"vehicle", "action":"lock|unlock|flash|find_car" }
 *       Composite cloud-first commands not registered in the catalog.
 *   { "kind":"api", "method":"POST", "path":"/api/...", "body":"{...}" }
 *       Fire an internal API action (surveillance, recording mode) for
 *       features that have no VehicleControlCatalog/SDK entity. Routed through
 *       {@link HttpServer#automationApiRequest} — the SAME auth-free, allowlisted
 *       path automations use — so it can only ever reach the curated control
 *       surface (/api/vehicle, /api/surveillance, /api/recording/mode), never the
 *       sensitive /api/debug|backup|update|... endpoints.
 *   { "kind":"automation", "id":"&lt;uuid&gt;" }
 *       Run a saved automation's actions on a keypress — the physical-key
 *       equivalent of the automation's trigger. Enqueued on the shared
 *       {@link app.wheelstop.android.automation.AutomationQueue} (checkConditions=true,
 *       so the automation's own conditions still gate it, and its run-stats update),
 *       NOT run inline — a chain may block for minutes on pause/waitUntil and must
 *       never tie up this HTTP worker. Deliberately NOT routed through the automation
 *       API allowlist (which excludes /api/automations on purpose): this is a
 *       dedicated in-process call, like {@code manualClip}. An unknown id is rejected;
 *       a disabled automation still enqueues but the worker skips it (logged no-op),
 *       matching how a disabled automation ignores its normal trigger.
 *   { "kind":"openApp", "package":"com.foo.bar", "label":"Foo" }
 *       Launch an installed app (resolves its launcher activity). Not gated —
 *       opening an app is no more privileged than a user tapping its icon.
 *   { "kind":"manualClip", "beforeSeconds":30, "afterSeconds":0 }
 *       Save a user-triggered instant replay from the encoded camera ring.
 *       Dedicated manual-only path: deliberately not routed through the
 *       automation API allowlist.
 *   { "kind":"shell", "cmd":"..." }         — advanced, gated by allowAdvanced
 *   { "kind":"sequence", "steps":[ {kind:...}, ... ] }
 *       Run several of the above actions in order on one keypress. Best-effort:
 *       a failing step is recorded but does not abort the rest.
 *
 * All actuation runs synchronously on the caller's request thread (the HttpServer
 * worker), never the app's input-dispatch thread — the a11y service fires the
 * POST on a background executor and does not block on the result.

    // The key-filter rides on KeepAliveAccessibilityService in the APP process,
    // which shares one heavy main looper with the WebView, two MapLibre GL
    // surfaces, four foreground services and the overlays. On a long-lived app
    // process we observed the OS leave that service stuck in AMS "Binding" and
    // never promote it to "Bound" — onServiceConnected never runs, onKeyEvent
    // never fires, so every mapped wheel button falls straight through to the
    // OEM (and because this firmware delivers one press as a burst, the OEM
    // action repeats — the "looping next-track" symptom). A FRESH app process
    // binds cleanly every time; the only reliable recovery is to kill the wedged
    // process so AMS re-binds into a new one (a toggle of the Secure setting does
    // NOT un-wedge it — verified on-device).
    //
    // This daemon runs as UID 2000, a DIFFERENT uid than the app, so it survives
    // `am force-stop app.wheelstop.android` (same reason SocCutoffMonitor pkills the
    // daemon separately). That makes it the stable supervisor: it periodically
    // checks the bind and, only when the service is enabled-but-not-bound for a
    // sustained window (a genuine wedge, not the transient async-bind gap after
    // enable), force-restarts the app so it respawns with a clean bind.
    //
    // Zero-cost + non-disruptive by construction:
    //   • Does nothing unless keymap is enabled AND at least one binding exists —
    //     the restart is FOR key mapping, so we never bounce the app for a
    //     feature the user hasn't configured.
    //   • The precondition-missing case (listed-but-master-off / not listed) is
    //     healed with the cheap `settings put` re-assert, never a restart.
    //   • The disruptive force-restart fires ONLY on a confirmed sustained wedge
    //     (keys already dead), is rate-limited so a pathological case can't
    //     restart-loop the app, and respawns HEADLESSLY (starts the keep-alive

     *   2. The Secure settings, read via the `settings` CLI (reliable as UID
     *      shell) — NOT the daemon ContentResolver, which returned false-negatives.
     *      This branch requires BOTH conditions the OS uses to bind a service:
     *      the component is listed in enabled_accessibility_services AND the master
     *      accessibility_enabled flag is 1. Listing alone is NOT proof — an install

     * (the bound instance lives in the app process), so only source #2 fires there.
     * Even a satisfied source #2 proves the OS <i>bind condition</i> is met, not
     * that the app-process service has finished binding (AMS binds asynchronously).
     * This is deliberately the PRECONDITION signal, kept distinct from the stronger
     * "actually bound" truth — see {@link #isAccessibilityServiceBound()}, which the
     * daemon CAN observe from UID 2000 via the service's ServiceRecord. Callers that
     * must not over-report "ready" (e.g. the enable edge, where AMS has not bound

     *
     * <p>Two independent sources, EITHER of which proves a live bind:
     *   1. In-proc {@link
     *      app.wheelstop.android.services.KeepAliveAccessibilityService#isRunning()}
     *      — set in onServiceConnected, cleared in onDestroy, so it is exactly the
     *      bound state. Ground truth when this handler shares the app process; in
     *      the UID-2000 daemon the instance lives in another process and this is
     *      always false, so we fall through to #2.
     *   2. {@code dumpsys activity services <component>} showing an active
     *      ServiceRecord (not {@code app=null}). AMS hosts every bound
     *      AccessibilityService as a real bound service, so a live ServiceRecord
     *      for our component means the app-process bind has completed — the same
     *      probe {@code ServiceLauncher.isLocationSidecarRunning} and
     *      {@code SentryDaemon} already use for their services, run in-daemon here.
     *
     * <p>Fail-safe: returns {@code false} on any read glitch or timeout (so the
     * client keeps the nudge / "enabling…" state rather than falsely hiding it),
     * matching {@link #isAccessibilityServiceEnabled()}'s conservative reporting.
