/**
 * Receives AAC frames from the app process (UID 10067) which captures from
 * the cabin mic and AAC-encodes inside StatusOverlayService. The daemon
 * (UID 2000 / shell) cannot open AudioRecord directly because BYD's
 * AudioPolicy denies non-app UIDs — see /api/audio/probe-mic-spoof
 * verification — so capture lives app-side and the encoded bitstream is
 * piped here for muxing into the same .mp4 the video pipeline writes.
 *
 * <h3>Wire format</h3>
 * Each message is length-prefixed:
 * <pre>
 *   [4 bytes BE]  totalLength (excludes the 4 length bytes themselves)
 *   [4 bytes BE]  msgType
 *   [N bytes]     payload
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>msgType=1 (CONFIG)</h4>
 * Sent once at connection start. Payload:
 * <pre>
 *   [4 bytes BE]  sampleRate (Hz)
 *   [4 bytes BE]  channelCount
 *   [4 bytes BE]  bitrate (bps)
 *   [4 bytes BE]  csd0Length
 *   [csd0Length bytes]  AudioSpecificConfig (CSD-0)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>msgType=2 (DATA)</h4>
 * One AAC access unit (raw, NO ADTS header — MediaMuxer wants raw AU).
 * Payload:
 * <pre>
 *   [8 bytes BE]  ptsUs (microseconds, monotonic with video)
 *   [N bytes]     AAC AU bytes (no ADTS)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
 * Single-client. A new connection terminates the previous one. The accept
 * loop runs on the thread spawned by CameraDaemon; the per-client read
 * loop runs on a short-lived worker thread so accept() can keep servicing
 * reconnects even while the previous worker is still draining its finally
 * block. The app disconnects (graceful close) when capture stops; we then
 * call {@link HardwareEventRecorderGpu#disableAudioMuxing} so any
 * in-flight recording closes out video-only — but ONLY if the closing
 * worker is still the active client (so a stale-closer can't undo a
 * fresh client's CONFIG). A surprise disconnect (process killed) hits
 * the same path via {@link IOException} on the next read.
 *
 * <h3>Why not extend SurveillanceIpcServer?</h3>
 * That server is JSON-line-based — fine for low-rate control messages,
 * but framing AAC packets as base64-in-JSON would burn ~33% bandwidth
 * for nothing. A separate length-prefixed binary socket keeps audio
 * cheap and keeps the JSON IPC simple.
