/**
 * OEM Dashcam settings API handler.
 *
 * Currently exposes the "Disable Native DVR" toggle for BYD's factory dashcam
 * package ({@code com.byd.cdr}). When the native DVR is disabled, our OEM
 * Dashcam pipeline owns the AVMCamera without contention — the factory app
 * stops opening AVMCamera on every ACC ON event and stops writing to
 * /sdcard/DCIM/BYDCam.
 *
 * <p><b>Permission model.</b> The HTTP server runs in the {@code CameraDaemon}
 * process which is launched via {@code adb shell ... app_process} and
 * therefore runs as UID 2000 (shell). UID shell is allowed to call
 * {@code pm disable-user --user 0 <pkg>} and {@code pm enable <pkg>}
 * directly, so this handler shells out via {@link Runtime#exec} without
 * needing an IPC roundtrip to AccSentryDaemon.
 * ({@code app.wheelstop.android.byd.TrafficMonitorPolicy} applies the same contract
 * to com.byd.trafficmonitor — both run in a UID shell daemon.)
 *
 * <p>Endpoints:
 * <pre>
 *   GET  /api/oem-dashcam/native-dvr/status   — { state, package }
 *   POST /api/oem-dashcam/native-dvr/disable  — runs pm disable-user, persists UCM
 *   POST /api/oem-dashcam/native-dvr/enable   — runs pm enable, persists UCM
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code state} is one of:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code "enabled"}    — package present and not disabled (factory DVR active)</li>
 *   <li>{@code "disabled"}   — package present and currently disabled (we own the camera)</li>
 *   <li>{@code "not_installed"} — no com.byd.cdr on this firmware (e.g. trims without OEM dashcam);
 *       UI hides the entire card on this state.</li>
 * </ul>
