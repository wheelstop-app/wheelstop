/**
 * Daemon-owned lifecycle controller for the OEM driver-cluster projection, used
 * ONLY when the blind-spot target is "cluster". It opens the OEM cluster
 * projection (so the cluster's {@code fission} PRESENTATION VirtualDisplay,
 * layerStack 1, materialises and our already-rendered blind-spot SurfaceControl
 * layer can be retargeted onto it), and — critically — guarantees the live gauges
 * are RESTORED on every exit path.
 *
 * <h3>Why this is safe to drive from here</h3>
 * The daemon runs as uid 2000 (shell), which is platform-signed. The OEM
 * container service's send-permission gate is a signature check
 * ({@code checkSignatures(selfUid, callingUid) == 0 → allowed}); a platform-signed
 * caller bypasses the package allowlist. Verified on-device: the projection
 * opcodes (size-profile / fullscreen-on / di4-mode / close / refresh) are accepted
 * from this uid (no SecurityException) and a uid-2000 SurfaceControl layer tagged
 * layerStack=1 composites onto the cluster.
 *
 * <h3>Projection is a FULL takeover</h3>
 * There is no partial/overlay cluster projection on this firmware — opening the
 * projection replaces the native gauges for its duration. To bound that, the
 * timing model is <b>lazy-open-on-first-signal + linger-close</b>: open on the
 * first turn-signal while armed for the cluster, stay open across the rapid blink
 * on/off phases, and close (restore gauges) after {@link #lingerCloseMs} of no
 * signal, or a hard {@link #maxProjectionMs} cap, or disarm/disable/shutdown.
 *
 * <h3>Gauge-restore guarantee (the whole point)</h3>
 * Every path that could leave the gauges blanked has a force-restore:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>blink-off → linger close (18→0)</li>
 *   <li>signal stuck-on → {@link #maxProjectionMs} cap force-closes</li>
 *   <li>ACC-off / disable / target→head-unit → {@link #forceClose}</li>
 *   <li>open-sequence error / ready-timeout → {@link #forceClose}</li>
 *   <li>daemon SIGTERM/normal exit → {@link #shutdown} fires 18→0 synchronously</li>
 *   <li>daemon SIGKILL → on respawn {@link #clearStaleGateAtBoot} reads the leaked
 *       UCM gate flag and blind-fires 18→0 (the opcode path is stateless)</li>
 * </ul>
 * NEVER sends opcode 1 (disconnects Qt entirely / destroys the display).
 *
 * <p>All opcode sends + sleeps run on a dedicated thread so the 250 ms blind-spot
 * turn loop and the GL thread are never blocked.
