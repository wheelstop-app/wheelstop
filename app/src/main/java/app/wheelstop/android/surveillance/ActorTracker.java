/**
 * ActorTracker — Persistent tracker that turns per-frame YOLO detections into
 * lifetime-aware {@link Actor} records.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - Sits on top of the existing motion+YOLO pipeline; does NOT replace it.
 *  - One tracker instance per surveillance engine; tracks across cameras.
 *  - Association: greedy IoU within the same quadrant; class-group must match.
 *    Cross-quadrant handoff is deferred to {@link CrossQuadrantTracker} which
 *    keeps doing what it does today — this tracker assigns its own actorIds and
 *    is independent.
 *  - Proximity is pixel-relative (no extrinsics). Calibrated thresholds on
 *    bbox-dim/quadrant-dim ratio.
 *  - Trend = sign of bbox-area change over the last {@code TREND_WINDOW} updates.
 *  - Static = bbox area + position stable for {@code STATIC_FRAMES_NEEDED}+ updates.
 *  - All inputs are in QUADRANT pixel coordinates (the same coordinate space
 *    SurveillanceEngineGpu uses today after foveated→quadrant scaling at lines
 *    1597–1598). The caller is responsible for any coordinate normalisation.
