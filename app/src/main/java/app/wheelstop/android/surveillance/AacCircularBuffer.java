/**
 * AacCircularBuffer — small in-memory ring of recent AAC access units, used to
 * give event recordings audio at frame 0 instead of the previous "5 seconds of
 * silent video at every event start".
 *
 * <p>This is the audio counterpart to {@link H264ByteRingBuffer}, but the
 * design is deliberately simpler: AAC frames at 64 kbps / 48 kHz / mono run
 * ~256 bytes each at 20 ms cadence (~50 frames per second). Even the internal
 * 62-second window is only ~3100 packets and under 1 MB of payload — small
 * enough that a lock-free deque + per-packet heap copies are cheaper and
 * easier to reason about than the seqlock-validated direct-byte arena the
 * video ring needs.
 *
 * <h3>Concurrency model</h3>
 * Single producer (the daemon's audio ingest thread, calling
 * {@link #add(byte[], int, int, long)}) plus a single consumer (the
 * trigger/event thread, calling {@link #drainAll()} or
 * {@link #snapshotRange(long, long)}). {@link #clear()} is called from start-up
 * and audio-disable paths. All operations are wait-free apart from
 * {@link ConcurrentLinkedDeque}'s internal CAS retries.
 *
 * <h3>Eviction</h3>
 * FIFO under a byte budget. The budget is sized for the configured pre-record
 * window with a 1.5× headroom so AAC frame-size variability (CBR is "constant"
 * only on average) doesn't truncate the window when a few back-to-back frames
 * land slightly above the bitrate-time product. At 62 s × 64 kbps that's
 * 62 × 64000 / 8 × 1.5 = 744 000 bytes — still negligible vs. the video
 * ring.
 *
 * <p>Note: the byte counter is best-effort under contention. {@link #drainAll}
 * resets it to zero after polling the deque so any concurrent {@link #add}
 * that lands during the drain (rare; the audio ingest thread is the sole
 * producer and a drain is microseconds) self-corrects on the next add — the
 * absolute count drifts within a packet's worth, which is well inside the
 * 1.5× budget headroom.
 *
 * <h3>What this ring does NOT do</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It does not synchronize with the muxer's audio track index. Drained
 *       packets that arrive before the muxer's audio track is wired up are
 *       discarded by the caller.</li>
 *   <li>It does not rebase PTSs. The trigger flow forwards each packet's
 *       absolute PTS into {@link HardwareEventRecorderGpu}'s muxer queue and
 *       the existing {@code writeRebasedAudio} machinery anchors them to the
 *       segment's {@code ptsOriginUs}.</li>
 *   <li>It is not bounded by header count. The byte budget alone is enough —
 *       the maximum window's budget at 256 B/packet caps the deque at roughly
 *       3000 entries.</li>
 * </ul>
