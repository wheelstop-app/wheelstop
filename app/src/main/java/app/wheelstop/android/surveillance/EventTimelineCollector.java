/**
 * SOTA Event Timeline Collector — With Semantic Pre-Record Ring Buffer
 *
 * Architecture: Dual-buffer inline coalescing.
 *
 * The collector maintains TWO buffers:
 *
 * 1. PRE-TRIGGER RING BUFFER (always active):
 *    A small circular buffer that continuously ingests motion and AI events,
 *    keeping the last ~15 seconds of semantic data. This mirrors the H.264
 *    circular buffer that keeps the last 15 seconds of video.
 *
 * 2. ACTIVE SPAN BUFFER (only during recording):
 *    The main span array that stores committed spans for the current event.
 *    When startCollecting(preRecordMs) is called, the pre-trigger ring buffer
 *    is flushed into this array with timestamps shifted to align with the
 *    video's pre-record window.
 *
 * This ensures the JSON sidecar captures YOLO detections and tracking data
 * that occurred during the approach phase BEFORE the recording trigger.
 *
 * Thread safety:
 * - All mutable state access is synchronized
 * - File I/O runs async on a dedicated MIN_PRIORITY thread
 *
 * Memory: ~360 KB (active) + ~22 KB (pre-trigger ring) = ~382 KB total
