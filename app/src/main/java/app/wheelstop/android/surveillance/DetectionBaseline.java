/**
 * Per-quadrant detection baseline for filtering static objects from YOLO output.
 *
 * Maintains a "living memory" of what objects are already in the scene so that
 * motion-triggered YOLO detections of static objects (parked cars, trash cans,
 * fire hydrants) are suppressed — only NEW or MOVED objects trigger recording.
 *
 * Update rules:
 * - Seeded once on sentry start (1 YOLO inference per quadrant)
 * - Updated event-driven: at the end of each motion event, the quadrant's
 *   baseline is refreshed from the YOLO detections already computed during
 *   the event. Zero extra inferences.
 * - Refreshed on lighting transitions (dawn/dusk) detected by Stage 1
 *   brightness shift. 1 inference per affected quadrant, 2-3 times per night.
 *
 * Safety rules:
 * - Living things (person, dog, cat, bird) are NEVER promoted to baseline.
 * - Spatial veto: if a detection overlaps with any person detection seen in
 *   the last 60 seconds of the event, it is NOT promoted regardless of class.
 *   This catches misclassification (crouched person labeled as fire hydrant).
