/**
 * SHADOW-MODE multi-batch AI-confirmation counter (parked-car single-frame
 * FP audit). LOG-ONLY: nothing in the trigger chain reads its verdicts.
 *
 * <p>Today a SINGLE qualifying YOLO frame stamps
 * {@code lastAiConfirmationElapsedMs} and authorizes recording (the final AI
 * gate's only key). The observed FP: shadows/reflections trip motion near a
 * baselined parked car, and one bad YOLO frame — the car split into two
 * vehicle boxes that fail the baseline's IoU/foot-point match, or part of the
 * car misread as a low-confidence person (class 0 bypasses the baseline by
 * design) — confirms the sequence and starts a recording. The next frame
 * returns to normal.
 *
 * <p>Candidate replacement under field validation: only confirm once the SAME
 * physical object has been observed across N(class) DISTINCT AI batches
 * within the current motion sequence. This class measures what that gate
 * WOULD have decided so the FN cost (real short-window subjects deferred) and
 * the FP win (one-frame blips that never reach N) are quantified on field
 * logs before anything is enforced.
 *
 * <p>Design choices (from the audit discussion):
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Keyed by CrossQuadrantTracker trackId</b>, not ActorTracker state.
 *       CQT is the identity layer: it has per-batch claim dedup
 *       ({@code claimedInBatch}, audit R11-9 — so a split-box pair cannot
 *       double-hit one track in a single batch), its IDs survive cross-camera
 *       handoff (ActorTracker's historyCount resets there), and it mints IDs
 *       for EVERY class (ActorTracker drops UNKNOWN class groups, which would
 *       silently make unknown-class new objects unconfirmable).</li>
 *   <li><b>One stamp per distinct batch</b>: a counter records the batch's
 *       source-frame observation time (elapsedRealtime domain) at most once,
 *       so within-batch duplicates can never inflate the count.</li>
 *   <li><b>Sequence scoping by comparison, not by reset</b>: "confirmed for
 *       this sequence" = stamps {@code >= firstMotionElapsedMs} reach
 *       N(class) — the same idiom {@code sequenceConfirmed} already uses.
 *       Stamps from a previous sequence stop counting on their own, closing
 *       the trap where a track carries hits across sequences for up to the
 *       tracker TTL (8s) and instantly certifies a later unrelated burst.</li>
 *   <li><b>Bounded confirmation window</b> ({@link #MAX_CONFIRM_WINDOW_MS}):
 *       the N batches must also fall within a recency window ending at the
 *       newest batch. A live sequence can persist for MINUTES (motion gap
 *       tolerance keeps refreshing it), so "within the sequence" alone would
 *       let a sporadic false box — one bad frame every ~30s of a long shadow
 *       storm — accumulate to N eventually. Real subjects produce batches at
 *       the motion-driven cadence and cluster well inside the window.</li>
 *   <li><b>Class-specific thresholds</b>: PERSON needs 2 (short-window
 *       walk-ups get few YOLO opportunities — the 2.5m bike/walk-up FN class
 *       cannot afford 3), VEHICLE/BIKE need 3 (persistent by nature; latency
 *       is cheap and they are the split-box FP shape), everything else
 *       (animals, unknown classes) 2 — the lenient, fail-open direction. No
 *       movement predicate in v1: a car that arrives and parks must stay
 *       confirmable by count alone, or its arrival clip (and the baseline
 *       learning it feeds) is lost.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Thread-safety: all methods synchronized; called only from the engine's
 * single-threaded aiExecutor today, but kept safe for future callers. State
 * is bounded ({@link #MAX_ENTRIES} counters × {@link #STAMPS_PER_TRACK}
 * stamps) and self-pruning ({@link #ENTRY_TTL_MS}).
