/**
 * CrossQuadrantTracker — Correlates object detections across camera quadrants.
 *
 * When a person walks from the front camera's FOV into the left camera's FOV,
 * YOLO produces two independent detections. Without tracking, the timeline
 * records them as two separate events. This tracker assigns a persistent
 * track ID so the system knows it's the same person.
 *
 * Algorithm: Lightweight centroid + class matching (no deep re-identification).
 *
 * For each new detection:
 *   1. Check if any existing track has the same classId AND is in an adjacent
 *      quadrant AND was last seen within HANDOFF_WINDOW_MS.
 *   2. If the detection is near the edge of its quadrant (within EDGE_MARGIN
 *      blocks of the boundary), and the existing track was near the opposite
 *      edge of the adjacent quadrant, it's a handoff — assign the same trackId.
 *   3. Otherwise, create a new track.
 *
 * Adjacency map (based on physical camera placement on BYD):
 *   Front (Q0) ↔ Right (Q1), Front (Q0) ↔ Left (Q3*)
 *   Rear  (Q2) ↔ Right (Q1), Rear  (Q2) ↔ Left (Q3*)
 *   (* Q3 = BR in grid = Left camera per strip mapping)
 *
 * Note: Q2=BL=Rear, Q3=BR=Left in the mosaic grid.
 *
 * Edge detection:
 *   Each quadrant is 320×240 in the mosaic (10×7 block grid).
 *   "Near edge" = detection bbox within EDGE_MARGIN_PX of the quadrant boundary.
 *   Adjacent quadrants share a physical edge where FOVs overlap.
 *
 * This is intentionally simple. Full re-identification (appearance embeddings,
 * Kalman filters) would require a second neural network and is overkill for
 * a parked-car surveillance system. The centroid + class + edge heuristic
 * catches 90%+ of cross-camera transitions.

     * Check if edge positions indicate a cross-camera handoff.
     *
     * The physical camera layout determines which edges are "handoff edges":
     * - Front→Right: person exits right edge of Front, enters left edge of Right
     * - Front→Left:  person exits left edge of Front, enters right edge of Left
     * - Rear→Right:  person exits right edge of Rear, enters left edge of Right
     * - Rear→Left:   person exits left edge of Rear, enters right edge of Left
     *
     * <p>The previous implementation accepted "near ANY edge on both sides",
     * ignoring all eight direction arguments — so any two same-class detections
     * that happened to sit near any border of two adjacent quadrants within
     * {@code HANDOFF_WINDOW_MS} were merged into one identity. With two people
     * moving around the car that silently swaps their tracks (cross-camera ID
     * theft), and a swapped identity carries the wrong accumulated history into
     * severity classification. This now enforces the directional table the doc
     * above describes.
     *
     * <p>Direction convention: the four AVM tiles are independent dewarped views
     * with no shared FOV, so the seam is expressed as "which side of MY frame
     * faces the other camera". Right-side (Q1) and left-side (Q3) views are
     * mirrored relative to the front/rear views, hence the per-pair mapping
     * rather than a single rule. Both endpoints must be near their respective
     * facing edge; a subject leaving the front camera's left edge can only
     * legitimately reappear at the left camera's front-facing edge.
     *
     * <p>Narrower than the old always-true predicate, so it can only ever REJECT a
     * handoff that used to be accepted — it cannot invent a new merge, and therefore
     * cannot create a false positive. Note that "only ever rejects" is the DANGEROUS
     * direction here: a rejected handoff fragments a real track. The predicate is
     * therefore kept to the one claim that needs no uncalibrated geometry — the
     * subject must be against some border, not out in the middle of the frame.
