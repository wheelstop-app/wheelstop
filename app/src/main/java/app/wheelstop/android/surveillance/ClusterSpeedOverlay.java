/**
 * Daemon-owned current-speed badge for the OEM driver-cluster projection.
 *
 * <p>The IC projection is a FULL takeover (see {@link ClusterProjectionController}):
 * opening it replaces the native gauges — including the native speedometer — for its
 * duration, and on this firmware the residual OEM speed band on the left edge is
 * clipped by our fullscreen content. This overlay restores a current-speed readout
 * that is INDEPENDENT of what is projected underneath (the nav map, the blind-spot
 * card, or any future projected surface), so the driver always sees their speed.
 *
 * <h3>How it composites</h3>
 * A uid-2000 {@code SurfaceControl} buffer layer tagged {@code layerStack=1} (the OEM
 * "fission" cluster display) — the SAME mechanism {@link BsNativeLayer} uses and that
 * is validated live on this firmware. Z-order is {@link #Z_ORDER} = one BELOW the
 * blind-spot card ({@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}) so a turn-signal blind-spot view is
 * never occluded by the speed badge. The badge is a small translucent "glass" rounded
 * rectangle, vertically centred on the LEFT of the panel, painted with
 * {@link Surface#lockCanvas} (no GL/EGL — it's just text at 2 Hz).
 *
 * <h3>Lifecycle</h3>
 * Driven entirely by {@link ClusterProjectionController}: {@link #start()} on
 * projection-ready ({@code commitReady}), {@link #stop()} on every teardown
 * (forceClose / shutdown). A SIGKILL'd daemon's layer dies with its process, so there
 * is no boot-recovery path to add (unlike the gauge-restore opcodes).
 *
 * <h3>Speed source</h3>
 * {@link app.wheelstop.android.byd.BydDataCollector#readCurrentSpeedKmh()} — the BYD SDK
 * instrument speed (ACC-gated, so live exactly while projecting during a drive). When
 * the SDK value is unavailable the badge shows "--" rather than a fabricated/estimated
 * number — the persistent glass badge stays, but never lies.
 *
 * <p>Threading: all SurfaceControl + Canvas work runs on the single-thread
 * {@link #exec} so the {@link Surface} is only ever touched from one thread.
