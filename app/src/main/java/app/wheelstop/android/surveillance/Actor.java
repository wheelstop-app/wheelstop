 * Actor — A persistent moving subject around the vehicle.
 *
 * One Actor represents one tracked entity (person, vehicle, bike, animal) across
 * multiple frames and possibly multiple cameras. Actors are produced by
 * {@link ActorTracker} from raw YOLO detections and consumed by:
 *  - {@link EventTimelineCollector}    for the per-recording JSON sidecar
 *  - {@link ThumbnailBuffer}          for picking the peak-severity frame
 *  - {@link SeverityClassifier}       for NOTICE/ALERT/CRITICAL gating
 *  - The notification + UI layers      for human-readable summaries
 *
 * No metric distance: everything that quantifies "how close" is a {@link Proximity}
 * band derived from bbox size in the camera frame, NOT calibrated extrinsics.
 * If extrinsics ever become available, swap the proximity classifier without
 * breaking any consumer.

     *    caption must honour the hard invariant "a person is never inferred-static
     *    from stillness — a loiterer keeps its count/SRT/chip". A real far still
