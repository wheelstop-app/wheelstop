/**
 * Smooth, continuous vehicle motion from SPARSE, jittery GPS fixes.
 *
 * <p>The daemon's `/api/gps` delivers a new fix only every ~1-2s (and re-sends the
 * SAME fix in between), so rendering straight off it makes the puck/camera TELEPORT
 * every couple seconds. This estimator decouples the two cadences:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #onTruthPoint} — called when a genuinely NEW fix arrives. It rejects
 *       bad-accuracy / out-of-order fixes, derives a stable bearing (from the
 *       position delta when moving, since raw GPS bearing is noisy), and EMA-blends
 *       the fix into a filtered state with a DISTANCE-ADAPTIVE alpha (snap hard on a
 *       small confident jump, ease gently on a big/uncertain one so GPS noise is
 *       absorbed). Speed and bearing are smoothed on their own factors.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #estimate} — called every RENDER FRAME (~12 fps micro-tick). Between
 *       fixes it dead-reckons the position FORWARD from the last filtered state along
 *       the smoothed bearing by {@code speed × elapsed}, capped at
 *       {@link #MAX_DEAD_RECKON_S}. So the puck glides continuously; it never
 *       outruns reality by more than ~1s of travel, and it FREEZES when stationary
 *       (raw GPS wanders when parked).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Pure Kotlin, framework-free (JVM-testable) — mirrors the rest of {@code nav/}.
 * NOT thread-safe; call from a single thread (the map's main/guidance thread).
 *
 * <p>The constants are tuned for a ~1-2s GPS cadence on a head unit; they are the
 * generic technique (accuracy-gated complementary filter + bounded dead-reckoning),
 * not specific to any one app.
