 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #start()} acquires the projection as a sustained holder (opens
 *       the OEM cluster projection if not already up, and suppresses the linger
 *       / max-cap auto-close so the map stays up for the drive).</li>
 *   <li>Once the fission display has materialised, launch {@code RoadSenseMapActivity}
 *       onto it via {@code am start --display N} (the same uid-2000 launch path
 *       AvcHalWarmup already uses on-car — no self-ADB needed). The Activity is
 *       told via an intent extra that it's on the cluster, so it renders the
 *       non-touch cluster view.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #stop()} releases the sustained hold; the controller restores the
 *       gauges (18→0) when no transient consumer still wants the projection.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Blind-spot coexistence: BS composites its own SurfaceControl layer at z=MAX
 * onto the SAME projection (it doesn't own the lifecycle while the map holds it),
 * so a turn signal always paints on top of the map. See the BS pipeline.
 *
 * <p>Safety: this class never bypasses the controller's gauge-restore net. ACC-off
 * / disable / SIGTERM / SIGKILL recovery all still fire through the controller
 * regardless of this holder. Default OFF — only runs when the user opts in.
