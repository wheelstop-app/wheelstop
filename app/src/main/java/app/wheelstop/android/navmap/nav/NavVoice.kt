/**
 * Thin Android [TextToSpeech] wrapper for spoken turn-by-turn guidance.
 *
 * <p>This is the only navigation-engine file (besides needing a [Context]) that
 * touches the Android framework. TTS initialization is asynchronous; until the
 * engine reports `SUCCESS`, [speak] calls are no-ops (we do NOT queue across
 * init — by the time TTS is ready the queued instruction would be stale, so we
 * simply drop pre-init speech). Once ready, each [speak] uses `QUEUE_FLUSH` so
 * the latest instruction replaces any still-playing one.
 *
 * <p>All calls are guarded so a TTS error never propagates to the caller.
 * Construct on the main thread (TextToSpeech requires a Looper); call
 * [shutdown] from the Activity's onDestroy.
 *
 * @param context any Context (application context is fine — held only for TTS
 *   construction; not retained beyond the TextToSpeech instance)
