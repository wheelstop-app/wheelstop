 * at capture time:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #lat}, {@link #lng} — coordinate. {@link Double#NaN} when
 *       there was no fix; the JSON writer omits the block in that case
 *       rather than emit (0,0) which would point at the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #accuracy} — GPS accuracy radius in meters. 0 when unknown.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ageMs} — wall-clock age of the underlying GPS fix at
 *       capture time. -1 when unknown. A 30+ s age is the visual cue that
 *       the location may not be reliable for narrow questions like "was
 *       the car at this exact street."</li>
 *   <li>{@link #capturedAtMs} — wall-clock at capture time.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #relMs} — milliseconds since the recording began. Only
 *       meaningful for {@code peak} captures (peak severity moment); 0 for
 *       {@code start}, equal to {@code durationMs} for {@code end}.</li>
