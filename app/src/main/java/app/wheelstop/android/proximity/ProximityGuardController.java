     * frames almost all of which were stride-skipped. Dropping the HAL capture
     * rate to monitorFps cuts that capture cost roughly proportionally.
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>MONITORING (low-power enabled) → monitorFps (~4) — the lean idle rate.</li>
     *   <li>RECORDING / POST_RECORD → 0 (full rate; an event clip is live, the
     *       camera must snap back to the configured recording fps).</li>

    /**
     * Re-derive the MONITORING draw stride against the CURRENT camera fps, but

     * changes the shared camera HAL fps for a non-proximity reason (e.g. a
     * live-view stream opening/closing raises/lowers the shared camera rate).
     *
     * <p>Why this is needed: applyMonitorProfile() computes stride =
     * round(cameraFps / monitorFps) and is otherwise only invoked on the
     * MONITORING state-entry. If the camera fps changes WHILE we are already
     * monitoring, the stride captured at entry no longer maps to the configured
     * monitor fps — the pre-record ring would over- or (worse) under-feed,
     * silently degrading pre-roll. Re-running applyMonitorProfile() here
     * recomputes the stride against the new camera fps so the effective monitor
     * rate stays at the configured value regardless of camera-fps changes.
     *
     * <p>No-op outside MONITORING (RECORDING/POST_RECORD own the full-rate event
     * profile; IDLE has no pipeline). Cheap: a couple of volatile pipeline writes.
     *
     * <p>MUST be {@code synchronized(this)}: this is the ONLY caller of
     * applyMonitorProfile() that runs OFF the controller's own state-machine
     * thread (it is invoked from RecordingModeManager's reconcile, on the
     * live-view stream HTTP/WS thread). Every other profile mutator
     * (applyMonitorProfile / applyEventProfile / restoreFullProfile /
     * start/cancelKeyframePulse) is reached only via transitionTo() under
     * synchronized(this). Without the monitor here, a stream open/close racing a
     * radar trigger could (a) interleave applyMonitorProfile() AFTER an
     * applyEventProfile() — stranding a live triggered clip at low monitor
     * fps+bitrate until the recording ends — and (b) double-enter
     * startKeyframePulse()'s null-guard and LEAK a ScheduledFuture (two pulses,
     * one un-cancellable). Holding the monitor across the state-check + apply
     * makes the "MONITORING ⇒ apply" decision atomic w.r.t. transitionTo, so the
     * re-derive can never land on top of a state that has since left MONITORING.
     * Lock order is safe: applyMonitorProfile only calls pipeline fps/stride/
     * bitrate setters, none of which fire RMM's stream/BS listeners (no reverse
     * controller-monitor → reconcileLock edge).
