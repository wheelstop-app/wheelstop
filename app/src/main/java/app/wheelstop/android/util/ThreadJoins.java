/**
 * Thread-join helpers for teardown paths that must honour their FULL deadline
 * even when the calling thread is (or arrives) interrupted.
 *
 * <p>Rationale (EGL-leak audit): a plain {@code thread.join(timeoutMs)} returns
 * immediately with an {@link InterruptedException} if the caller is interrupted,
 * and callers that swallowed it then read a HEALTHY teardown as wedged (or, worse,
 * proceeded as if the thread had exited and dropped the reference). For GL-owning
 * threads that misread pins an EGL context in the driver's context table; for a
 * codec drainer it races the camera close into a FORTIFY destroyed-mutex abort.
 * These helpers wait out the real deadline across interrupts, record any swallowed
 * interrupt in {@code interruptedHolder[0]} so the caller can restore the thread's
 * interrupt status after teardown, and report honestly whether the thread exited.
