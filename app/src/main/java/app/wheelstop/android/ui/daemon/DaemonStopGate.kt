package com.overdrive.app.ui.daemon

/**
 * Decides whether a daemon is under a *stop intent* and must not be (re)started.
 *
 * Two stop signals, both plain files under `/data/local/tmp`:
 *  - the per-daemon **user-stop sentinel** (`DaemonType.sentinelPath`) — written by the Daemons UI
 *    or by a Telegram `/daemon <x> stop`, which records the stop ONLY in this cross-UID file and
 *    never in the app's SharedPreferences;
 *  - the **parked-shutdown marker** — in "Vehicle ON only" the whole stack is torn down on park and
 *    must stay down until the ACC-on edge clears the marker.
 *
 * The two callers want different policies, so they get named entry points rather than a boolean:
 * [isStartBlocked] (startup — sentinel only) and [isRelaunchBlocked] (health check — sentinel OR
 * park marker). Passing the wrong policy is the kind of mistake a boolean invites and a name does
 * not, and it matters: mixing them up would let the 30s health check revive a parked stack.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * These files used to be probed with `test -f … && echo STOPPED || echo OK` sent over the app's own
 * ADB connection, with the caller's real work happening inside the reply callback. That makes a
 * required decision depend on a reply that is not guaranteed to arrive: `AdbShellExecutor.execute()`
 * swallows `RejectedExecutionException` once its executor is shut down, and `initializeOnAppLaunch()`
 * shuts down the previous manager's executor during the bootManager→Activity handoff, so work that
 * manager had already `postDelayed` can no-op with no log line.
 *
 * HONESTY NOTE — that failure mode is structural, not observed. It was originally believed to be the
 * cause of tailscaled failing to auto-start on a BYD Seal head unit, but instrumenting the executor
 * (correlation-id SUBMIT/RUN/DONE logging, plus lock- and probe-timers) disproved it: every command
 * in that chain was submitted, ran, and returned exit 0, with no rejections and no lock contention.
 * The original symptom turned out to be a measurement artifact in the diagnosis harness. This change
 * therefore removes a genuine fragility and is NOT a fix for that bug — do not cite it as one.
 *
 * SCOPE — this gate covers the DECISION only. The ACTION it guards (`startTailscaleOnBoot`, and the
 * `vm.startDaemon` paths) still runs over the per-manager ADB executor, so a handoff that lands
 * mid-chain can still lose the start. That half is addressed separately, by
 * `AdbShellExecutor.submit()` rerouting a rejected command to a process-wide executor rather than
 * dropping it. Neither change alone closes the window; read them together.
 *
 * ## What makes the local check valid — and its one blind spot
 *
 * `File.exists()` needs **search (`x`) permission on every parent directory**, not read permission
 * on the file; the sentinels' `0666` mode is irrelevant to it. What actually makes this work is
 * `/data/local/tmp` being `0771` plus permissive SELinux for the app domain on this head unit. That
 * is empirically established: `BootReceiver`, `DaemonKeepaliveService`, `StatusOverlayService` and
 * `LocationSidecarService` already read the park marker this way from the app process, and park
 * mode works in the field.
 *
 * **Blind spot:** `File.exists()` cannot throw here (no SecurityManager; `stat`/`access` failures
 * such as EACCES or an unsearchable parent simply return `false`). So `false` means "absent **or
 * invisible**", and this class cannot tell them apart. If a future OTA tightens `/data/local/tmp`
 * or SELinux, both signals silently read absent — resurrecting user-stopped daemons and, worse,
 * letting the health check relaunch the whole stack every 30s while parked. Nothing in-process can
 * distinguish the two cases, so callers that care should verify visibility out-of-band rather than
 * trusting a bare `false`.
 *
 * Kept as pure functions over an injected `exists` predicate so the policy is unit-testable without
 * a device, an ADB connection, or a filesystem.
