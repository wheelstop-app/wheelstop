     * Re-arm the CORE surveillance daemons (camera / sentry / acc-sentry) by
     * clearing their disable sentinels on every startup (boot AND app launch).
     *
     * Product decision: a user stop of a core daemon is honored for the rest
     * of the session (the health-check sees the sentinel and won't relaunch),
     * but core surveillance ALWAYS re-arms on the next boot / app restart — we
     * never want the dashcam backbone to stay silently dead across a park.
     * Clearing the core sentinel here is what implements that re-arm.
     *
     * OPTIONAL daemons (tunnels, telegram, singbox) are deliberately NOT
     * cleared here: their stop is meant to PERSIST across restarts. They are
     * additionally pref-gated for UI stops, but a Telegram `/daemon zrok stop`
     * records intent ONLY in the sentinel (it never touches the app's
     * SharedPreferences, and its legacy .properties file is unreadable across
     * the UID boundary) — so wiping their sentinel here is exactly what used
     * to resurrect a Telegram-stopped tunnel on the next launch. Leaving it in
     * place is the fix. The user re-starting the daemon from the UI clears it
     * via DaemonsViewModel.clearDisableSentinel.
     *
     * Routes through this manager's shared AdbDaemonLauncher rather than
     * letting callers allocate a fresh one — a fresh AdbDaemonLauncher
     * spawns a fresh AdbShellExecutor (single-thread non-daemon executor)
     * that's never shutdown(), so it leaks a parked thread per call.
