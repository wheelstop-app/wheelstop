/**
 * Pure boot-timing policy for the daemon startup sequence.
 *
 * Extracted from [DaemonStartupManager.initializeOnBoot] so the ordering rule is
 * unit-testable without a Looper, a Context, or an ADB connection.
 *
 * The rule that matters is the Tailscale lead. The MQTT publisher lives inside the
 * camera daemon, and when the tunnel is enabled a LAN broker is normally reachable
 * ONLY through the SOCKS proxy that tailscaled exposes. Starting the camera daemon
 * first means the publisher wakes, finds no proxy and — per issue #182 — defers.
 *
 * What that deferral costs is small, and NOT the 300s backoff an earlier version of
 * this comment claimed. The #182 fix is already in this branch's history, and its
 * whole point is that it does *not* bump `consecutiveFailures` while waiting on the
 * proxy: `MqttConnectionManager` therefore re-probes at the min-interval floor
 * (`DEFAULT_MIN_INTERVAL` = 5s) and connects the moment the listener binds. A few
 * seconds of ordering slip costs a few seconds of telemetry.
 *
 * The lead earns its keep at the TAIL, not the average. The deferral is bounded by
 * `PROXY_WARMUP_GRACE_MS` (60s), after which the publisher gives up waiting and falls
 * through to a direct dial — which off Wi-Fi can never reach a LAN address, so the
 * connection then churns until something restarts the daemon. With the core daemons
 * first, tailscaled is only *launched* at 60s and needs a further 10–40s, while the
 * grace window opens when MQTT first defers (~45–50s): that lands near the edge of
 * the window, and past it the failure is the bad one. Leading with tailscaled moves
 * the proxy up to ~40–70s, comfortably inside. Buying that margin is the point — not
 * the handful of seconds saved on a good boot.
