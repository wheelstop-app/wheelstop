/**
 * SOTA single-camera zoom over the AVM recording mosaic.
 *
 * The recordings are written by [app.wheelstop.android.surveillance.GpuMosaicRecorder]
 * as a single MP4. Two compositions exist (see [Layout]):
 *
 *   STANDARD — a 2x2 grid of the four AVM cameras:
 *       Front (TL) | Right (TR)
 *       -----------+-----------
 *        Rear (BL) | Left  (BR)
 *
 *   DASHCAM — the front camera across the top band, with the
 *       left / rear / right cameras tiled across the bottom band in thirds.
 *
 * There is no per-camera stream on disk. To play "just the front camera in
 * fullscreen" we keep the same MP4 and apply a TextureView matrix that maps
 * the chosen camera's sub-rectangle of the frame to fill the view — the user
 * sees a single camera at native source resolution (1280×960 Seal / 1280×720
 * Tang) with zero re-encode, full audio, working scrub. Which sub-rectangle a
 * [Quadrant] denotes depends on the clip's [Layout].
 *
 * Why TextureView (not VideoView): VideoView wraps SurfaceView whose
 * compositor-blitted surface ignores View transforms. TextureView routes
 * the producer through the SurfaceTexture path so [setTransform] applies
 * to every frame. Trade-off: TextureView burns a few MB more GPU memory
 * than SurfaceView (one extra texture ping-pong). At 2560×1920 @ 30 fps
 * this is negligible compared to the encoder side of the device.
 *
 * Lifecycle: this view owns a [MediaPlayer]. The player is created lazily
 * once the SurfaceTexture is available AND a URI has been set; calling
 * [setVideoURI] before the surface is ready stashes the URI and re-runs
 * setup when [onSurfaceTextureAvailable] fires. The player is fully
 * released in [stopPlayback] / on detach.
