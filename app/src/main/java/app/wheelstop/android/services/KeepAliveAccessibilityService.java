/**
 * Minimal AccessibilityService that keeps the app process alive indefinitely.
 *
 * Android's OOM killer and OEM process killers (including BYD's DiLink firmware)
 * are hardcoded to never kill a process hosting an active AccessibilityService.
 * This gives our app the highest possible process priority — same tier as the
 * keyboard or phone call — preventing the 24-hour kill cycle on newer BYD firmware.
 *
 * The service itself is a no-op for accessibility events. Its sole purpose is
 * process keep-alive. The foreground notification provides user visibility.
 *
 * Enable via ADB (one-time):
 *   settings put secure enabled_accessibility_services app.wheelstop.android/app.wheelstop.android.services.KeepAliveAccessibilityService
 *   settings put secure accessibility_enabled 1
