/**
 * Streaming elevation gain/loss estimator shared by the LIVE scoring path
 * (TripScoreEngine) and the RECOVERY path (TripDatabase.reconstructTripFromTelemetry),
 * so the two can never drift apart again (they previously hand-synced a 2.0 m
 * deadband constant and used different sampling/trim rules).
 *
 * Why this exists — GPS altitude is the noisiest GNSS axis (vertical error is
 * typically 1.5-3x horizontal). The old implementation fabricated climb totals
 * three ways:
 *  1. Count-based decimation ("every 5th sample") that never averaged, so each
 *     retained sample carried full noise amplitude;
 *  2. A 2 m full-delta deadband ratchet that banked the ENTIRE noise excursion
 *     (threshold included) every time jitter crossed ±2 m — parked or idling,
 *     since nothing gated on movement;
 *  3. No vertical-accuracy gate and no reset when the altitude source flipped
 *     between MSL and ellipsoidal height (a 30-60 m geoid step banked as climb).
 *
 * The pipeline here:
 *  1. GATE: samples must be movement-eligible (not in Park / not gear-unknown
 *     at standstill), carry a plausible altitude, and pass the vertical-accuracy
 *     gate when the fix reports one.
 *  2. RESET: the filter state is cleared when the MSL/ellipsoid source flips or
 *     after a long gap in accepted samples, so a step change in the altitude
 *     datum can never be integrated as real climb.
 *  3. SMOOTH: a time-based (10 s) moving MEDIAN over accepted altitudes. Median
 *     (not mean) so a single multipath spike inside the window contributes
 *     nothing. Works at both the live 5 Hz rate and the recovered 1 Hz rate
 *     because the window is defined in time, not sample counts.
 *  4. HYSTERESIS: direction-change counting on the smoothed signal. Movement is
 *     only banked after the smoothed altitude has moved >= threshold away from
 *     the last confirmed extremum. Noise oscillating inside the threshold band
 *     contributes exactly zero; a real sustained climb pays the threshold cost
 *     ONCE per direction change instead of once per banked delta (a naive
 *     "delta - threshold" ratchet systematically zeroes out real climbs that
 *     arrive in threshold-sized increments). The threshold is the noise floor
 *     or the fix's own reported vertical accuracy, whichever is larger.
