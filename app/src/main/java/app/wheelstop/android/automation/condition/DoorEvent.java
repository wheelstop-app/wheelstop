/**
 * Publishes door open/close edges into the automation state so a "when the driver door
 * opens" trigger / "if boot is open" condition can be evaluated.
 *
 * <p>Event-driven, NOT polled: subscribes to {@link BydDataCollector.DoorStateListener}
 * (the same raw bodywork open/close edge {@link app.wheelstop.android.notifications.DoorEventNotifier}
 * uses) and republishes each edge as a {@code doorState} event keyed by area. Unlike
 * the notifier, this does NOT gate on parked/driving — an automation may legitimately
 * want to react to a door opening while driving (e.g. a chime), so every genuine edge
 * is published; the user narrows it with their own conditions.
 *
 * <p>Areas mirror the notifier's mapping, including the drive-side L↔R front-axis swap,
 * so "driver" / "passenger" line up with the physical door on both RHD and LHD trims.
 * A convenience {@code any} area is also published ("any door/lid open?") so a user can
 * trigger on "any door opened" without wiring one condition per door.
