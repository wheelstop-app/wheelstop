     * This is deliberately an explicit allowlist rather than "default any absent variable":
     * silently substituting a value turns a malformed action into one that ACTS, and many
     * first-options are real vehicle operations.

     * <p>{@code zone} — the ambient colour/brightness actions gained a zone selector. "both"
     * means all zones, which is exactly what those actions did when they had no zone concept
     * (and matches the daemon's own {@code optString("zone", "both")} default).
     *
     * <p>{@code autoOffMinutes} — the AC power action ({@code setAc}) gained an optional "switch off
     * again after N minutes" window (the standalone {@code acAutoOff} action declares the same
     * variable, but it is new, so no saved automation can be missing the key there). "0" means stay on indefinitely, which is exactly what those
     * actions did before the window existed (and what the daemon's own
     * {@code optInt("autoOffMinutes", 0)} default does). Stored as the STRING "0" because the
     * variable is an EnumType, whose isValid() matches option ids — an Integer 0 would fail
     * validation and drop the automation, the very thing this map exists to prevent.
