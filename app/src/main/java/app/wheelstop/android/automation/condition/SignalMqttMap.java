/**
 * Automation signal id → the MQTT telemetry key publishing the SAME fact.
 *
 * <p>Purely a read-only cross-reference for the trigger/condition picker, for users who
 * drive one car from both automations and Home Assistant. The two surfaces name things
 * differently on purpose — signals are attribute-addressed camelCase in the condition
 * grammar ({@code speed:units=kmph}), MQTT keys are flat snake_case HA entities — and
 * renaming either side would break saved automations ({@code Automation.fromJson} drops a
 * rule whose condition id no longer resolves) or HA entity ids (derived from the field key
 * in {@code HomeAssistantDiscovery}). So the names stay put and this maps between them.
 *
 * <p><b>Cosmetic only — never stored, never resolved against.</b> Mirrors
 * {@link app.wheelstop.android.automation.AutomationCategories}: an unmapped id yields null and
 * the picker simply shows no twin, so a newly-added signal can never break by being absent.
 *
 * <p>Every entry below was verified against the actual {@code payload.put(...)} call in
 * {@code MqttConnectionManager} — NOT inferred from name similarity, which is wrong in
 * several cases worth knowing about:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code power} (signal) is the IGNITION level and maps to {@code power_level};
 *       the MQTT key {@code power} is drive-motor kW, an unrelated fact.</li>
 *   <li>{@code temperature} maps to {@code inside_temp} ({@code insideTempC}, the field the
 *       signal reads), not the similarly-named {@code cabin_temp} ({@code insideTempCelsius},
 *       a different reader).</li>
 *   <li>{@code batterySoh} maps to {@code soh_oem} ({@code sohPercent}, what the signal
 *       publishes); MQTT {@code soh} is the SohEstimator display value.</li>
 *   <li>{@code chargingState} maps to {@code is_charging} (the fused verdict both use); the
 *       near-identically-named MQTT {@code charging_state} is a raw BMS enum.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A signal with NO twin is deliberately absent rather than mapped to a near-miss: e.g.
 * {@code lock}, {@code energyRegen}, {@code autoWiper}, {@code autoLights}, and every
 * non-vehicle signal (time, wifi, bt, location, surveillance, variable, mqttTrigger) publish
 * nothing comparable. {@code doorState} is the sharpest near-miss and is documented inline
 * below: {@code door_lock} is lock state, not open/closed, and is all-UNAVAILABLE on this HAL.
 *
 * <p>An ATTRIBUTE-addressed signal maps to the key(s) covering the whole family, since one
 * signal id spans every area/seat/side: {@code seatbelt} and {@code window_open} are arrays
 * of slots, {@code pm25} has one key per area. Where the signal is a DERIVED reduction of
 * such a key (e.g. {@code radarNearest} is the closest of {@code radar_distances}; the
 * {@code occupant} driver seat is inferred and published to MQTT at all only for the
 * passenger), the twin is the underlying key — the same fact, not always the same number.
