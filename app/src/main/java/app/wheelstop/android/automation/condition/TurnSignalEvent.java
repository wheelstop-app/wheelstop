/**
 * Publishes the left/right turn-indicator on/off state into the automation state at a
 * FAST cadence so a "when I signal left" automation fires promptly.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a dedicated fast poll.</b> The other vehicle events piggy-back on the
 * telemetry snapshot ({@link BydEvent#bydEvent}), which is built sub-second while
 * DRIVING but only every ~5s while STATIONARY (the 250ms fast-dynamics poll does not
 * call {@code build()}). A turn signal is most often used while stopped or crawling
 * (waiting to turn / pulling out), so sampling it on the 5s stationary cadence meant
 * the trigger lagged the driver's flick by up to ~5s — the reported "long delay". The
 * blind-spot overlay already reads the lamps at 250ms, but that runs in the APP
 * process and never feeds the (daemon-side) automation state. This poll closes that
 * gap by reading the same reliable combined getter ({@code readTurnNow}) directly on
 * the daemon at a fast cadence.
 *
 * <p><b>Zero cost unless a turn automation exists.</b> Mirrors {@link NetworkEvent}
 * self-gating, but tightened one level: the poll reschedules
 * itself every tick yet does NO SDK read unless {@link Automations#isEventReferenced}
 * reports an enabled automation actually triggers on {@code turnSignal}. So the fast
 * cadence is paid ONLY while a turn-signal automation is configured — an idle feature
 * costs just a parked scheduler thread ticking a cheap O(small) map check. The debounce
 * / on-hold semantics live in {@link BydEvent#publishTurnFromPoll}, shared with the
 * previous snapshot path so the edge behaviour is identical, just sampled faster.
