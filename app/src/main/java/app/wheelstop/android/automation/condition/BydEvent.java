     * next full collect (up to 90s while parked) every partial {@code toBuilder().build()} in the
     * tree republishes the PREVIOUS level. Since the edge is published the instant it fires, that
     * stale republish would fight it and strobe the rule (Invariant 1/2c).
     *
     * <p>Dropping the publish — rather than rewriting the snapshot field — keeps this free of side
     * effects: correcting the field would need a {@code build()}, which re-fires this whole method
     * and would flip the powerLevel-gated AC publish below.
     *
     * <p>The ON/OFF SIDE decides STALENESS: a level on the other side of the last edge is a
     * carried-forward pre-edge value and is dropped. But agreeing on the side does not make the
     * snapshot's publish a NEW EVENT — the two publishers have different vocabulary widths. The
     * edge is boolean (off/on only); the snapshot reports off/acc/on. Accessory mode is ACC-off
     * across the stack, so {@code acc} agrees with an OFF edge and used to pass this gate as an
     * ordinary off→acc transition, which FIRED. One key turn traverses several stored states
     * (off→acc→off as the level settles), so every {@code power} rule ran two or three times per
     * cycle; field report: "car power on is triggered more than once".
     *
     * <p>So for {@link #POWER_EDGE_SETTLE_MS} after an edge, a same-side level is treated as the key
     * still rotating toward the position the edge already reported: the edge's own word is RESTATED
     * (stored, fires nothing, delivery mark untouched) and any other word — {@code acc} on the way
     * through — is DROPPED. Outside that window the snapshot publishes normally, because it is then
     * the only witness to a state the driver actually selected.
     *
     * <p>Three bounds, each one an audit finding from an earlier attempt (2026-08):
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Drop {@code acc}, do NOT store-without-firing. Storing it makes it the current value,
     *       so every later republish of level 1 is a non-transition and can never fire — which
     *       swallowed a genuine key-to-ACC outright. Dropping leaves the edge's word stored, so the
     *       first republish past the window is still a real transition.</li>
     *   <li>Bound the special-casing by this SHORT window, not the 150s stale-value grace. That
     *       grace exists for a CONTRADICTING level; an agreeing-side level cannot be the stale
     *       carried-forward value, so {@code acc} here is a fresh reading.</li>
     *   <li>Bound the RESTATEMENT too, not just the drop. Unbounded, a driver who sat in accessory
     *       mode (delivering {@code acc}) and then turned the key fully off had that {@code off}
     *       restated instead of delivered — "when power turns off" never ran for the rest of the
     *       parked session, and the stale mark then killed {@code acc} as well.</li>
     *   <li>Do NOT special-case ACC under an ON latch. It looks asymmetric (the other side, so the
     *       150s grace rather than the 5s settle), but rotating the key ON→ACC fires a real ACC-OFF
     *       edge — accOn is {@code powerLevel >= POWER_LEVEL_ON} — which re-latches to the off side,
     *       after which the level agrees and takes the ordinary settle path. An ACC level under a
     *       LIVE ON latch is therefore a stale mid-sweep reading, which is precisely what the grace
     *       suppresses. A "confirm window plus latch release" tried here on the opposite premise
     *       re-fired "power turns on" on every rule save while the key sat in accessory, because the
     *       release cleared the state the replay guard reads.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>Only a level in the real OFF/ACC/ON vocabulary is published — see
     * {@link #isRealPowerLevel}. That covers {@link BydVehicleData#UNAVAILABLE} (bodywork device
     * absent, or its getter returned a non-Number) AND the HAL's OK(3)/FAKE_OK(4)/INVALID(255)
     * bluffs: all stringify to {@code unknown(N)}, which no condition can match, and 3/4/255 also
     * pass the ON-side staleness check, so they would be stored under an ON latch and break every
