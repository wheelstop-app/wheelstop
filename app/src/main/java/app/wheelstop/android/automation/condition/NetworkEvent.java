/**
 * Publishes WiFi connection state / SSID (and a one-shot system-boot event) into the
 * automation state so wifi and boot triggers can be evaluated.
 *
 * <p>Design notes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Low cadence, and only while enabled.</b> The poll runs every
 *       {@link #POLL_SECONDS}s but does nothing (and does not touch the network) when
 *       no automation is enabled — {@link Automations#isDisabled()} is an O(1) field
 *       read, so an idle feature costs only a parked scheduler thread. This keeps the
 *       "no automation configured => no extra compute" property honest and avoids the
 *       daemon-CPU class of problem from always-on shell polling.</li>
 *   <li><b>WiFi state is an edge.</b> {@link Automations#update} only fires evaluation
 *       on a real value transition, so republishing the same SSID every poll is free.</li>
 *   <li><b>Boot fires once per daemon start.</b> {@code boot=on} is published exactly
 *       once per process, eagerly at the first schedule (daemon start ≈ the head unit
 *       coming up), so it can't be missed or delayed. It does NOT gate on device uptime:
 *       the daemon is often launched minutes after the device booted (and again on an OTA
 *       / watchdog restart), so an uptime window silently dropped the event on the common
 *       path. The one-per-process guard is the dedup — it can't re-fire within a run.</li>
 * </ul>
