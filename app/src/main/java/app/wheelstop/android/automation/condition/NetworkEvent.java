/**
 * Publishes WiFi connection state / SSID (and a one-shot system-boot event) into the
 * automation state so wifi and boot triggers can be evaluated.
 *
 * <p>Design notes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Only while referenced.</b> The Wi-Fi task exists only while an enabled rule reads
 *       Wi-Fi state or SSID. Disabling the last reference cancels it completely.</li>
 *   <li><b>WiFi state is an edge.</b> {@link Automations#update} only fires evaluation
 *       on a real value transition, so republishing the same SSID every poll is free.</li>
 *   <li><b>Boot fires once per daemon start.</b> {@code boot=on} is consumed exactly
 *       once after saved configuration loads, so it can't be manufactured by adding a rule
 *       later. It does NOT gate on device uptime:
 *       the daemon is often launched minutes after the device booted (and again on an OTA
 *       / watchdog restart), so an uptime window silently dropped the event on the common
 *       path. The one-per-process guard is the dedup — it can't re-fire within a run.</li>
 * </ul>
