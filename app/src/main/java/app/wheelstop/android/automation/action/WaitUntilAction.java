/**
 * Automation action that blocks the action chain until a chosen scalar vehicle
 * signal satisfies a comparison, or a timeout elapses.
 *
 * <p>Example: "when I park (gear = P) → wait until speed = 0 → close windows". The
 * wait runs on the single {@link app.wheelstop.android.automation.AutomationQueue} worker
 * thread, so — like {@link PauseAction} — it delays only the rest of THIS
 * automation's chain, never the telemetry/HTTP threads or other automations.
 *
 * <p>It polls the SAME live automation state ({@link Automations#getStateValue}) that
 * triggers and conditions evaluate against, so it observes exactly the values the
 * telemetry/network/bluetooth events publish. Polling (not event-driven blocking) is
 * deliberate: the worker must stay simple and killable, and a short poll interval is
 * cheap for a bounded wait.
 *
 * <p>Scope is intentionally the SCALAR signals for which "wait until &lt;x&gt;
 * &lt;compare&gt; &lt;n&gt;" is meaningful (speed, pedals, steering, battery,
 * temperature, range). Enum/string signals (gear, lights, wifi) are better expressed
 * as a trigger+condition; keeping this to numeric signals avoids the multi-variable
 * sub-key plumbing and keeps the form a flat, self-explanatory row.
