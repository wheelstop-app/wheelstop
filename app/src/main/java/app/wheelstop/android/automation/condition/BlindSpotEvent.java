/**
 * Publishes blind-spot, rear-cross-traffic, and door-open warning families as
 * distinct per-side automation states.
 *
 * <p><b>What this is not.</b> This is the OEM's radar warning — "is there a
 * vehicle beside me right now" — not the side-camera blind-spot overlay. The two
 * are unrelated: the overlay is a video feature in the app process, this is a
 * daemon-side vehicle signal.
 *
 * <p><b>Belt and braces, because the raw signal is a pulse.</b> The HAL reports
 * these warnings as momentary events, not as a level that stays asserted for the
 * duration of the hazard. Two paths therefore feed the same state:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Instant</b> — the ADAS {@code onDataEventChanged} callback calls
 *       {@link #onAlert} the moment a warning arrives. This is what makes the
 *       trigger feel immediate.</li>
 *   <li><b>Poll</b> — a fast self-gated poll reads the same registers, covering
 *       trims where the filtered event registration isn't honoured. Without it a
 *       firmware that never delivers the event would silently never fire.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Alert hold.</b> A pulse can't be published raw: "on" would be followed by
 * "off" on the very next tick, so a rule would see a strobe rather than a
 * warning. Any alert therefore holds "on" for {@link #ALERT_HOLD_MS}, and only a
 * genuinely quiet window publishes "off". The hold is refreshed by every new
 * alert, so a sustained hazard stays "on" throughout.
 *
 * <p><b>Zero cost unless a blind-spot automation exists.</b> The fallback task is absent
 * while neither side is referenced. The instant callback also returns before touching state
 * when its side has no enabled reference.
