/**
 * Publishes the per-seat seatbelt buckled/unbuckled state — and the per-seat OCCUPANCY state,
 * which comes off the same safety-belt device — into the automation state at a FAST cadence so
 * a "when the driver buckles" / "when the passenger seat becomes occupied" automation fires
 * promptly. The two signals are gated independently, so a rule on one never pays for the other.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a dedicated fast poll.</b> The seatbelt state otherwise rides only the main
 * telemetry poll ({@link BydEvent#bydEvent}), which builds every ~5s while stationary —
 * and buckling happens while parked/stopped. So the trigger lagged the buckle by up to
 * ~5s (the reported "takes 2-3 seconds"). This poll reads the same reliable
 * {@code getSafetyBeltStatus(area)} getter the telemetry-recording overlay uses, directly
 * on the daemon at a fast cadence, and publishes on change. Exact mirror of
 * {@link TurnSignalEvent}.
 *
 * <p><b>Zero cost unless a related automation exists.</b> The scheduled task is cancelled
 * when no belt or occupancy signal is referenced.
