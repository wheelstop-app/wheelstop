/**
 * A saved seat/mirror position selector. The value is a position id (String) from
 * OverDrive's own position store, not one of the car's hardware memory banks.
 *
 * <p>Modelled on {@link AppType}: the option set is NOT baked into the schema, because
 * positions are created and deleted by the user at runtime and captured entries differ
 * per signed-in DiLink profile. The frontend renders it as a dropdown populated live
 * from {@code GET /api/positions} and resolves the stored id back to the position's
 * name for display.
 *
 * <p>Storing the id rather than the name is deliberate. A captured entry's name is
 * rebuilt from the car on every capture ("&lt;nickName&gt; - &lt;slot name&gt;"), so a
 * name-keyed automation would silently stop matching after a rename in the car. The id
 * is the store's upsert key and survives both re-capture and rename.
 *
 * <p>Reuses {@link StringValue} as its backing value so no new Value type or
 * {@code Automations.update} overload is needed (same trick as AppType/ColourType).
