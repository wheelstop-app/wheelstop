/**
 * AVC HAL Warmup — ensures the BYD camera HAL is initialized by com.byd.avc
 * BEFORE our daemon opens the camera.
 *
 * PROBLEM: When ACC turns ON, both our daemon and the native DVR (com.byd.cdr)
 * race to open the panoramic camera. If our daemon opens first, the HAL enters
 * a state where the native DVR can't attach its surface → "no video signal."
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * 1. Launch com.byd.avc silently (the camera HAL initializer, NOT the DVR)
 * 2. Wait 4 seconds for the HAL to fully initialize in multi-consumer mode
 * 3. THEN open our camera as a secondary consumer
 *
 * Additionally, a 60-second keep-alive watchdog re-pokes com.byd.avc while
 * the pipeline is running, regardless of ACC state. BYD's system can kill
 * the camera app after inactivity, which destabilizes the HAL for all
 * consumers — including during ACC OFF sentry mode when the head unit stays
 * awake (charging, surveillance armed).
 *
 * LIFECYCLE:
 * - start() when pipeline starts (any mode, any ACC state)
 * - stop() when pipeline stops OR daemon shuts down
 *
 * <p><b>DiLink 4 (June 2026 reversal).</b> Empirically the AVMCamera HAL on
 * byd_apa only delivers mosaic content into the panoramic producer surface
 * when ANOTHER consumer is attached to the same vendor.byd.avm daemon —
 * com.byd.avc is exactly that consumer. Killing AVC made post-ACC-OFF frames
 * go all-zero (Frame 1 size dropped from ~80 KB to ~350 B). We now COOPERATE
 * with AVC on dilink4 like esco does: warm it on entry AND keep-alive ticks
 * keep it propped up. The red "calibration failed" chrome that AVC paints
 * is suppressed cosmetically by the GL red-mask shader (already in place),
 * so we no longer need to evict AVC at all. Legacy cars (90% of fleet)
 * unchanged.
