/**
 * AiLaneGl — dedicated GL thread for the AI lane (mosaic readback + foveated
 * crops) running on a separate EGL context that <i>shares</i> the encoder's
 * texture/program/PBO objects via the share group.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Before this class, the encoder GL thread was
 * responsible for both {@code eglSwapBuffers} (which gates MediaCodec input)
 * and {@code glReadPixels} into AI buffers. On Adreno 610 the OpenCL
 * inference (TFLite GPU delegate) and OpenGL command stream share the same
 * hardware queue, and {@code glReadPixels} against an FBO that the GPU is
 * mid-OpenCL on inserts an implicit pipeline barrier. The encoder swap
 * stalls behind that barrier — visible in the recorded MP4 as freeze+skip
 * exactly during event windows where YOLO inference is busy. Putting the
 * AI-lane reads on a different GL thread (and different EGL context, but
 * same share group) means the encoder thread's swap cadence is decoupled
 * from any AI-induced GPU stalls.
 *
 * <p><b>Shared share group.</b> The encoder thread creates the camera OES
 * texture (via {@link HardwareBufferTextureBinder#bindHardwareBufferToTextureNative})
 * and is the sole writer to it. This thread reads it. EGL spec guarantees
 * that textures created in one context are observable from another context
 * in the same share group; we serialize cross-context visibility by having
 * the encoder thread call {@code GLES.glFlush()} before notifying us, and
 * having us start each frame's work with a no-op state setup that ensures
 * we observe the latest texImage uploaded from the encoder thread.
 *
 * <p><b>Drop policy.</b> If a frame arrives while we're still processing
 * the previous one, the new arrival is collapsed (latest wins). The AI
 * lane already throttles itself internally to ~10 Hz via
 * {@code MOTION_PROCESS_INTERVAL_MS}, so missed AI frames are invisible.
 * What matters is that the encoder thread never blocks on us.
 *
 * <p><b>Lifecycle.</b> {@link #start} brings up the thread and shared
 * context. {@link #setConsumers} wires the downscaler and (after lazy init)
 * the foveated cropper. {@link #notifyFrame} is the per-frame entry point
 * the encoder thread calls. {@link #shutdown} drains in-flight work and
 * releases GL resources.
