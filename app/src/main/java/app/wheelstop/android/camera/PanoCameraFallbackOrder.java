/**
 * Ordered fallback camera IDs for a panoramic slot that opens but never streams.
 *
 * <p>Background (issue #170, and the #117-class reports before it): on BYD
 * head units running the "2602" firmware generation
 * ({@code 13.1.33.2602030.1}) with a legacy {@code pano_h} board, the profile's
 * panoramic camera ID (1 for {@code legacy_seal_atto}) still opens
 * successfully — {@code AVMCamera.open()} returns true — but the HAL reports a
 * 0x0 preview, so {@code addPreviewSurface} fails with err 423 and
 * {@code startPreview} with err 279. Those failures happen inside the HAL and
 * never surface as a Java exception, so the pipeline believes it has a healthy
 * camera and waits forever for a frame that cannot arrive.
 *
 * <p>Camera ID <b>0</b> on those boards delivers the raw four-fisheye strip
 * directly and needs no pano wake ({@code sys.byd.pano} stays 0 throughout), so
 * it is the reliable escape hatch. The BYD AVM HAL's own tag map agrees:
 * {@code BMMCamProp} reports {@code mCamIdPanoH=0} on this hardware.
 *
 * <p>The order below is therefore: the HAL's own panoramic tag mapping first
 * (authoritative when {@code BmmCameraInfo} is present), then the raw-strip
 * slot 0. The list is deliberately short — it is walked only when a camera has
 * <em>never</em> produced a single frame, and each attempt costs a HAL
 * close/open cycle, so we do not sweep every slot 0-5 and risk grabbing the
 * reverse-camera or dashcam sensor. The existing full-matrix auto-probe already
 * covers the "camera streams, but the picture is wrong" case.
 *
 * <p>Pure logic, no Android dependencies, so it is directly unit-testable.
 *
