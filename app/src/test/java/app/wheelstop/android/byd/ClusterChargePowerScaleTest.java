/**
 * Pins {@link BydDataCollector#scaleClusterChargePowerKw(double)} as an IDENTITY.
 *
 * <p>This function previously divided any reading above 22 by 100, inferring the unit from the
 * magnitude. That inference is unsound: the same numeric band holds both a genuine DC-charging
 * rate (60-500 kW) and a plausible cumulative-counter value, so no threshold can separate them.
 * Applying it displayed a real 150 kW session as 1.5 kW, and it was only contained by restricting
 * the field to one drivetrain — which denied the other drivetrain the vehicle's own dash figure.
 *
 * <p>The unit question now belongs to {@link ChargeSourceClassifier}, which decides from how a
 * value MOVES across a charge (a counter only rises; a rate dips). These tests exist to stop the
 * magnitude heuristic being reintroduced: any scaling here is a regression, because a caller
 * cannot tell a scaled value from an unscaled one and would silently price the difference.
