 * Deliberately narrow: these pin the *relative order* of the phases, which is the property the
 * Tailscale lead depends on and the one a careless edit to the constants would invert. They do NOT
 * assert the absolute values — those are tuning, not contract — and they cannot prove the lead is
 * long enough in the field (tailscaled's own start latency was measured between 10s and 40s on the
 * head unit, so the fixed lead narrows the race rather than closing it; see DaemonBootSchedule).
