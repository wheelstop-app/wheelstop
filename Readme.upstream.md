## Quick Start (Use Pre-built APK)

Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yash-srivastava/Overdrive-release/releases/tag/alpha) and install it directly on your BYD head unit.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Ensure **Wireless ADB** is enabled on your device before launching the app.

### 2. Initial Configuration
1. **Authorize ADB:** On first launch, accept the ADB authentication prompt on your device screen.
2. **Background Persistence:** In Settings, ensure the **"Disable Autostart"** toggle is **unchecked**. This is critical for reliable background operation.

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Hard Reboot Required**
> After the first installation and initial run, you must hard reboot the device:
> Press and hold the **Volume Down** button for 5 seconds. Wait for the system to fully restart.
> This step is necessary to finalize the installation.

### 3. Network & Tunnel Setup

Enable your preferred tunnel (Zrok, Cloudflared or Tailscale).

### Telegram Notifications Setup
1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram → `/newbot` → follow prompts → get your bot token
2. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) → `/start` → copy your Chat ID
3. In OverDrive: Settings → Notifications → enter bot token & chat ID

- **Telegram Notifications** — Instant alerts for motion detection, recording events, and low battery
- **Recording Library** — Calendar view for browsing and managing recordings

## Remote Access

Three options for viewing your car's cameras remotely:

### Local Network (LAN)
Access at `http://<car-ip>:8080` when on the same WiFi. Zero setup, fastest streaming.

### Cloudflare Tunnel
Access from anywhere via `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com`. No port forwarding, HTTPS by default. Video streaming can be slow due to Cloudflare limitations.

### Zrok Tunnel (Recommended)
Free, open-source tunneling with no bandwidth limits at `https://<your-share>.share.zrok.io`. Best for video streaming.

**Quick Zrok setup:**
1. Sign up at [zrok.io](https://zrok.io)
2. Get your invite token from email
3. Enter token in OverDrive settings
4. Done — tunnel URL is auto-generated

### Tailscale Tunnel
Free, with no bandwidth limits. Connect from any device connected to tailscale.

**Quick Tailscale setup:**
1. Sign up at [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com/)
2. Open tailscale settings in Overdrive
3. Generate a login URL and login
4. Optionally, disable key expiry in tailscale if you would not like to log in every 6 months

#### Tailscale proxy
With tailscale enabled, the tailscale proxy can be enabled from the tailscale settings.
This allows accessing an MQTT server through tailscale without port forwarding.
This can be accessed via the tailscale IP or a subnet that has been advertised on tailscale.

## Home Assistant Integration

OverDrive can publish your vehicle's live telemetry to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) over MQTT **and** let Home Assistant send commands back to the car (climate, windows, seats, charge limit, and more). Entities appear in Home Assistant automatically — **no YAML editing required**.

> **Everything is local.** Commands are sent straight to the car's own software (the BYD SDK on the head unit). They **never** go through the BYD cloud. Your data and controls stay between your car and your Home Assistant.

### What you get

- **Sensors (read-only):** battery %, range, speed, location (as a device tracker on your HA map), tyre pressures, cabin/battery temperature, charging state, doors/windows status, and more.
- **Controls (optional, off by default):** climate on/off + temperature + fan, windows, tailgate, sunroof/sunshade, seat heating/ventilation, daytime running lights, charge limit, child lock, wireless phone charger, and assorted car settings.

### Before you start — what you need

1. A running **MQTT broker**. If you use the [Mosquitto add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/mosquitto) in Home Assistant, you already have one.
2. The **MQTT integration** enabled in Home Assistant (Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → MQTT).
3. Your broker's **address and port** (default port is `1883`, or `8883` for TLS), and a **username/password** if your broker requires one.
4. Your car and Home Assistant able to reach each other on the network. If they're not on the same LAN, enable the **Tailscale proxy** (see [Tailscale proxy](#tailscale-proxy) above) so the car can reach your broker without port forwarding.

### Step 1 — Add the connection in OverDrive

Open OverDrive → **MQTT** (sidebar or app drawer) → **Add Connection**, then fill in:

| Field | What to enter |
|---|---|
| **Connection Name** | Anything, e.g. `Home Assistant` |
| **Broker URL** | Your broker's host, e.g. `192.168.1.10` (or `mqtts://...` for TLS) |
| **Port** | `1883` (plain) or `8883` (TLS) |
| **Username / Password** | Only if your broker requires login (leave blank otherwise) |
| **Topic** | Leave the default `overdrive/vehicle/telemetry` unless you have a reason to change it |

> **Self-signed / Mosquitto TLS certificate?** Enable the **trust self-signed certificates** option on the connection so OverDrive accepts your broker's cert.

### Step 2 — Turn on Home Assistant discovery

1. Switch on **Home Assistant discovery**.
2. Leave **Discovery prefix** as `homeassistant` (this matches Home Assistant's default — only change it if you customised yours).
3. Save. Within a few seconds a new **OverDrive** device appears in Home Assistant under Settings → Devices & Services → MQTT, with all the sensors already populated.

That's it for read-only telemetry. ✅

### Step 3 — Enable controls (optional)

By default OverDrive only *publishes* data — it ignores any command. To let Home Assistant actually control the car:

1. On the same MQTT connection, turn on **Allow vehicle control** (this option only appears once Home Assistant discovery is enabled).
2. Save. The controllable entities (climate, windows, seats, charge limit, …) now show up on the OverDrive device in Home Assistant, and you can operate them from any dashboard, automation, or voice assistant.

> ⚠️ **Safety:** "Allow vehicle control" is **off by default** and is a real control path to your car. Some actions move physical parts (windows, tailgate, sunroof). Only enable it on a broker you trust, behind a username/password, and ideally on a private network or your Tailscale tailnet.

### Using the controls

Once discovery + control are on, the entities are standard Home Assistant entities — drag them onto a dashboard, call them from automations, or ask your voice assistant. No topic juggling needed.

#### Advanced: sending commands manually

Under the hood every control listens on `<topic>/<key>/set` (where `<topic>` is the connection's Topic from Step 1, default `overdrive/vehicle/telemetry`). Handy for testing with `mosquitto_pub` or for templated automations:

```bash
# Climate: turn on, set 21 °C, fan speed 3
mosquitto_pub -t 'overdrive/vehicle/telemetry/climate/mode/set'        -m 'auto'
mosquitto_pub -t 'overdrive/vehicle/telemetry/climate/temperature/set' -m '21'
mosquitto_pub -t 'overdrive/vehicle/telemetry/climate/fan_mode/set'    -m '3'

# Vent the cabin / open windows
mosquitto_pub -t 'overdrive/vehicle/telemetry/windows_all/set' -m 'OPEN'   # or CLOSE / STOP

# Charge limit: enable and cap at 80 %
mosquitto_pub -t 'overdrive/vehicle/telemetry/charge_cap_enabled/set' -m '1'
mosquitto_pub -t 'overdrive/vehicle/telemetry/charge_cap_percent/set' -m '80'

# Daytime running lights on
mosquitto_pub -t 'overdrive/vehicle/telemetry/drl/set' -m 'on'
```

Full list of controllable entities and their accepted payloads:

| Control | Key | Payloads |
|---|---|---|
| Climate mode | `climate/mode` | `off`, `auto` |
| Climate temperature | `climate/temperature` | `17`–`33` (°C) |
| Climate fan | `climate/fan_mode` | `0`–`7` |
| Windows | `windows_all` | `OPEN`, `CLOSE`, `STOP` |
| Tailgate | `tailgate` | `OPEN`, `CLOSE`, `STOP` |
| Sunroof | `sunroof` | `OPEN`, `CLOSE`, `STOP` |
| Sunshade | `sunshade` | `OPEN`, `CLOSE`, `STOP` |
| Driver / passenger seat heating | `seat_heat_driver`, `seat_heat_passenger` | `off`, `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| Driver / passenger seat ventilation | `seat_vent_driver`, `seat_vent_passenger` | `off`, `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| Recall driver seat memory | `seat_memory_driver` | `PRESS` |
| Daytime running lights | `drl` | `on` / `off` (or `1` / `0`) |
| Speed-limit warning | `adas_slw` | `on` / `off` |
| Charge limit on/off | `charge_cap_enabled` | `1` / `0` |
| Charge limit % | `charge_cap_percent` | `50`–`100` (step 5) |
| Child lock | `child_lock` | `1` / `0` |
| Phone wireless charger | `wireless_charging` | `1` / `0` |
| Car settings | `setting_<name>` | depends on setting (on/off, a number, or a fixed list) |

### Troubleshooting

- **No OverDrive device in Home Assistant?** Check the MQTT connection shows **Connected** in OverDrive, confirm the **Discovery prefix** matches HA's (default `homeassistant`), and make sure the HA MQTT integration points at the *same* broker.
- **Sensors show but controls are missing?** "Allow vehicle control" isn't enabled — see Step 3 (it only appears after discovery is on).
- **A command does nothing?** The car must be awake/accessible to the head-unit SDK for that action. OverDrive optimistically updates the entity, then the next telemetry refresh reconciles the true state.
- **Broker on a different network?** Enable the [Tailscale proxy](#tailscale-proxy) so the car can reach it without port forwarding.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yash-srivastava/Overdrive-release.git
```

Set up signing by exporting these environment variables before building:

```bash
export KEYSTORE_FILE=/path/to/your/release.jks
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_password
export KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
export KEY_ALIAS=your_alias
```

Then build with Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## VLESS Proxy Setup (Optional)

The ISP blocklist bypass feature uses a VLESS Reality proxy. The app ships with placeholder credentials — you need to supply your own.

1. Edit `app/src/main/cpp/secrets/secrets.json` and fill in your VLESS server details:
   ```json
   "proxy": {
     "PROXY_SERVER_IP": "your.server.ip",
     "PROXY_SERVER_PORT": "443",
     "PROXY_UUID": "your-uuid-here",
     "PROXY_SHORT_ID": "your-short-id",
     "PROXY_PUBLIC_KEY": "your-public-key",
     "PROXY_SNI": "google.com"
   }
   ```

2. Encrypt each value using the helper script:
   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   python3 generate_safe_enc.py "your.server.ip"
   ```

3. Replace the corresponding `Safe.s("...")` values in `app/src/main/java/com/overdrive/app/daemon/GlobalProxyDaemon.java` (lines 71–79).

4. Rebuild the app.

If you don't need the proxy feature, you can skip this — the app works fine without it.

## Zrok Token Setup (Optional)

If you want to use Zrok tunneling for remote access, you need your own Zrok invite token:

1. Sign up at [zrok.io](https://zrok.io) and get your invite token from email
2. Enter the token in the app: Daemons → Zrok settings
3. If building from source, also replace `YOUR_ZROK_TOKEN` in `app/src/main/java/com/overdrive/app/daemon/telegram/DaemonCommandHandler.java` with your token (this is only used for the Telegram bot's `/tunnel zrok` command)

## Privacy

- 100% local storage — all recordings saved on device
- No account required
- No cloud upload — remote viewing is direct via tunnels
- Open source — audit the code yourself

## Translations

OverDrive's UI is translated through [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/overdrive). The app currently ships in **16 languages** (English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Norwegian Bokmål, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese), with another ~14 languages open for community translation (Polish, Czech, Romanian, Catalan, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Hebrew, Arabic, Serbian, Ukrainian, Afrikaans).

### How to help

1. Sign up at [crowdin.com](https://crowdin.com) (free).
2. Visit the [OverDrive project](https://crowdin.com/project/overdrive) and click **Join**.
3. Pick a language and translate strings directly in Crowdin's web editor — **no GitHub or coding required**.

New strings get auto-pre-translated by AI; translators just need to review and correct rather than start from scratch. Brand names (BYD, OverDrive, Tailscale, etc.) are protected — Crowdin's glossary marks them "do not translate".

When you save translations they enter as suggestions. Once enough community translators agree, or a proofreader approves, they land in the next release via an automated pull request.

### Want proofreader access?

If you've contributed substantial translations for a language, open an issue or DM the maintainer for **Proofreader** role — that lets you approve translations directly without waiting for review.

Zero new dependencies — uses the existing OkHttp stack and Java crypto libraries.
- **3D BYD Vehicle Models** — Vehicle Control page uses base models from [ddiaz-design's BYD collection on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/ddiaz-design/collections/byd-base-models-5bf92ab5f2be4ff6be5c3ac49f7099f3).
- **BYD Dashcast** — Overdrive projection to instrument cluster uses some vetted techinques of [BYD-Dashcast](https://github.com/Kiroha/byd-dashcast), a fantastic open-source project for application projection.

## Changelog

Condensed highlights below. Full release notes for every version live in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

### v35.0 — July 2026: Blind-Spot Camera Fixes & Pick-Your-Overlay

**✨ New Features**
- **Blind-spot side/rear views** — Correct single-camera feed with per-side rotation, per-side screen position, and a fisheye-correction slider
- **Choose your overlay fields** — The burned-in overlay is now a checklist: keep the usual speed, gear, pedals, seatbelts, turn signals and timestamp, or add **battery %, 12V voltage, low/high beam, and GPS location**. Pick per recording type — trips/manual, surveillance, and OEM dashcam each have their own list
- **Overlay on surveillance too** — Sentry event clips can now carry the overlay (off by default), with its own separate field selection

**⚡ Optimizations & Fixes**
- **Blind-spot reliability** — Single-camera passthrough (sliders only affect the merged view), stripped release logs, and arming that a disable can't undo
- **HUD On/Off** *(speculative — please confirm on your car)* — The HUD on/off action now toggles the dedicated head-up-display power switch instead of just dropping brightness to zero, so "off" actually turns the HUD off
- **Bluetooth connect/disconnect triggers** *(speculative)* — Bluetooth connection state is now watched from the app and relayed to automations, so "when Bluetooth connects / disconnects" rules should fire
- **Bluetooth device-name condition** *(speculative)* — The connected phone's name is now populated alongside the connection state, so a "only while &lt;my phone&gt; is connected" condition can match
- **Play Video** *(speculative)* — Reworked how the video player is launched (and how the video button/key-mapping fires) to fix uploaded MP4s not starting on screen

---

### v34.0 — July 2026: Projection, Smarter Automations & Reliability Fixes

**✨ New Features**
- **Choose when Overdrive runs** — Pick "On & Off" (keeps watching while parked, the default) or "On Only" (fully shuts down when you park and starts back up when you switch the car on — no overnight battery use)
- **Low-power mode while parked** — Optional setting that drops the cameras to a low idle frame rate when nothing's happening and instantly ramps back to full quality on motion
- **Projection** — Cast an app to the driver cluster and see a live, draggable, resizable mirror of it on the main screen — tap and swipe the mirror to control it
- **On-screen messages** — New "Show Toast" and "Show Dialog" actions put a message on the screen from any automation or button, floating over whatever's on screen without taking over the car
- **Compare against a variable or another signal** — If / Else, Loop, and Wait-Until can now compare a value against one of your variables or against another live signal
- **Set a variable from the car's live state** — A "Set Variable" action can capture the current value of a signal into a variable to use later
- **Air recirculation control** — Switch the air intake between recirculate and fresh air from an automation or a mapped button

**⚡ Optimizations & Fixes**
- **Play Video works now** — Uploaded MP4 videos wouldn't start (from either an automation or a button); they now play correctly on screen
- **Seatbelt automations fire** — The driver/passenger belt state was read the wrong way and never updated. Fixed, with a de-glitch so a never-fastened passenger seat reads correctly
- **Cabin-temperature automations fire** — "Cabin temp" was reading the climate dial (your setpoint) instead of the measured cabin temperature. It now reads the real sensor
- **Double-tap bindings no longer trigger the single action** — More forgiving detection window, plus a new **Double-tap speed** slider on the Key Mapping page
- **Fold/unfold mirrors reliability** — Aligned the mirror-fold command with the reference behaviour so it reports success correctly
- **Ambient-light colour picker redesign** — Tap-to-pick swatch grid matching the Vehicle Control page, instead of a fiddly slider

---

### v33.1 — July 2026: Cast to the Cluster, More Automation Signals & Reliability Fixes

**✨ New Features**
- **Cast any app to the driver cluster** — A "Move app to display" automation/button can now send an app to the instrument cluster behind the wheel
- **Save reusable action groups from the app** — Build a named set of actions once, then run it from any automation or button, with a proper Groups tab
- **Lock and regen as triggers & conditions** — React to the car locking/unlocking, and to the energy-recuperation level (Standard / High / Max)
- **Block a button's single-click** — Optional per-binding setting so a double-press action isn't preceded by the button's normal single-click

**⚡ Optimizations & Fixes**
- **More triggers & conditions fire reliably** — Gear (incl. Park), seatbelt, drive/EV mode, hazards, high/low beam, auto-lights, incline and parking-radar were reading a stale value; they now update live
- **If / Else automations save correctly** — The "Otherwise" branch was being dropped on save; both branches now persist
- **Action groups save reliably** — Fixed a wiring bug that made every group save fail
- **Automation editor polish** — Consistent field widths, tidier action-group cards, cleaner condition value picker
- **Lower parked power use** — Fast pedal/steering polling now stops when the car is off

---

### v33.0 — July 2026: Programmable Automations, Full ADAS Control & More Ways to React

**✨ New Features**
- **Automations that can think** — Loops, an inline If / Else branch, number variables, and reusable action groups
- **Smarter conditions** — Nested AND / OR groups, and compare one live value against another (cabin vs outside temp)
- **One automation controls another** — enable/disable/toggle a rule from another. Name them, see how often each runs, and fire any from a mapped button
- **Full ADAS control** — blind-spot, traffic-sign, cross-traffic alert & brake, traffic-light, door-open & rear-collision warning, speed-limit, lane-keeping, forward-collision, hazards. Emergency Braking is re-arm-only, never off
- **More to control** — WiFi / Bluetooth / data, AC auto & fan-only, heated wheel, welcome & reading lights, ambient music, headlight level, media, volume, brightness, speak-aloud and app navigation
- **More to react to** — drive & EV/HEV mode, sunrise/sunset, date, rain-soon, an incoming call, and what the **parked camera** sees (person, vehicle or animal)
- **Home Assistant, both ways** — publish an MQTT message from a rule, and trigger a rule from an incoming one
- **Edit shared automations** — update a community automation you published in place, keeping its ratings and downloads

**⚡ Optimizations & Fixes**
- **Sounds and videos play now** — the Play Audio / Video actions were silent on many cars
- **Driver seat heating no longer also turns on the passenger seat**
- **Double-press-only buttons work again** — a single tap now passes through to the car's own function. **"Close all windows"** from a button works too
- **Door open/close automations work while parked** — no longer need the car on
- **Stability Control & wireless charging toggles fixed**; key mapping recovers faster after a dropped button-capture service

---

### v32.0 — July 2026: Camera Views, Your Own Sounds & Smarter Automations

**✨ New Features**
- **Show any camera on screen — on demand** — Front, rear, left, right or all-four, on the main infotainment screen or the instrument cluster, at the size and corner you pick. Fire it from an automation ("show rear on reverse") or a mapped button, with optional auto-hide
- **Play your own sounds and videos** — Upload MP3/WAV/MP4 to the new Audio Library, then play from an automation or button
- **Many more things your car can react to** — New triggers for accelerator/brake pressure, steering angle, indicators, the emergency alarm, tyre pressure/leak warnings, and your phone connecting over Bluetooth by name
- **Rules that know where you are** — A location trigger fires when you enter or leave a mapped Safe-Location zone. Zones now go as small as 15 m (was 50)
- **More you can control** — Cluster and head-up-display brightness, volume per channel, and brake pedal feel (Comfort/Sport)
- **Pause and wait in a routine** — Pause for a set time, or wait until a value is reached ("wait until stopped, then close windows")
- **Toggle with one button** — Mapped buttons can flip a setting on, then off on the next press

**⚡ Optimizations & Fixes**
- **Edit a key mapping in place** — Edit an existing binding instead of deleting and re-adding
- **Steering & pedal rules fire reliably** — Fixed the steering reading sticking at start-up, and stopped a momentary "unavailable" reading from firing a rule by mistake
- **Turn-signal rules don't flicker** while you wait to turn
- **EV / HEV switching hardened** — a guard ensures the powertrain only ever selects a valid mode
- **Fully translated** across all shipped languages

---

### v31.0 — July 2026: Community Automations, Ambient Automation, App Launcher & Live Deterrents

**✨ New Features**
- **Community Automations — browse, share and rate** — A new Community tab to discover automations other drivers built and add them with one tap (switched off, so you can review them first). Publish your own, rate the ones you like, and sort or filter by rating, adds or recency
- **Ambient light automation — and more ways to trigger** — Set the interior ambient light colour as an automation action, or straight from the Vehicle Control page. New triggers react to current speed, the time of day, and the day of the week — plus a copy button to duplicate an existing automation
- **Open any app — from an automation or a button** — Launch any installed app automatically when an automation fires, or bind it to a steering-wheel/dashboard button with Key Mapping
- **Horn and Flash on the live camera view** — Dedicated Horn and Flash buttons right on the live camera feed to deter anyone near your car
- **Separate MQTT heartbeat for parked, charging and normal** — Independent heartbeat sliders let you slow telemetry publishing right down when the car is parked or charging

---

### v30.2 — July 2026: Custom Key Mapping

**✨ New Features**
- **Key Mapping — make the car's buttons do what you want** — Rebind your steering-wheel and dashboard buttons. Capture a button (or type its code), pick single, double or long press, and choose what it does — lock or unlock, open the windows, tailgate, sunroof or sunshade, toggle climate, seat heating or cooling, daytime lights, flash the lights or find your car. Find it under **Vehicle → Key Mapping**
- **One button, a whole routine** — Chain several actions into a single press. One button can close the windows, lock the doors and switch to ECO — in order, every time
- **Switch drive and energy modes anywhere** — Change drive mode (ECO / Sport / Normal / Snow), powertrain (EV / HEV), energy recuperation and steering feel — as button mappings, automation actions, and from Home Assistant / MQTT
- **Run scripts and open apps automatically** — Bind a shell command to a button or fire one from an automation. Off by default behind a separate permission, with a clear warning before you turn them on

**⚡ Optimizations & Fixes**
- **Instant settings** — Key-mapping changes now take effect the moment you save
- **Fully translated** — Every new screen and label is available in all supported languages

---

### v30.0 — July 2026: Automation Support

**✨ New Features**
- **Automations — your car reacts on its own** — Build your own "when this, do that" rules. Pick a trigger from a vehicle event (power state, gear, battery level, windows and more), add conditions, and choose what happens — open or close the sunroof, sunshade or windows, switch lights or seat heating and cooling on, set the speed-limit warning, or send yourself a notification
- **Animals show up on the event timeline** — When the camera spots an animal, it now appears on the recording's timeline and subtitles alongside people and vehicles

**⚡ Optimizations & Fixes**
- **Smoother MQTT** — Optimizations so your car's data flows more reliably to Home Assistant and other tools
- **Better Brazilian Portuguese** — Cleaned up the Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR) translations

---

### v29.0 — July 2026: Tune Each Camera, Catch Every Alert
